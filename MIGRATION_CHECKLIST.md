# Error Message Migration Checklist

Track your progress as you migrate files to use centralized error messages.

## Quick Start

1. Open `MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md` for complete before/after examples
2. Look at placeholder classes at bottom of `app/utils/error_messages.py`
3. Migrate files one at a time
4. Check off as you complete each file

## Progress Tracker

### Overall Stats
- **Total files to migrate**: ~35 files
- **Total violations**: ~255
- **Files completed**: 0
- **Violations remaining**: 255

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Check your progress
python3 tests/test_error_message_compliance.py 2>&1 | grep "Total violations"

# Test a specific file after migration
pytest tests/test_error_message_compliance.py -v -k "test_no_hardcoded"

# See which files still have violations
python3 tests/test_error_message_compliance.py 2>&1 | grep "File:" | sort | uniq -c
```

## Migration Steps (Copy-Paste)

For each file:

### Step 1: Check placeholder class
```bash
# Look at bottom of error_messages.py
grep -A 20 "class _YourFileMessages" app/utils/error_messages.py
```

### Step 2: Copy messages to main classes
Copy constants from `_YourFileMessages` to:
- `ErrorMessages` for errors
- `SuccessMessages` for success messages
- `WarningMessages` for warnings

### Step 3: Add imports to route file
```python
from app.utils.error_messages import ErrorMessages as EM
from app.utils.error_messages import SuccessMessages as SM
from app.utils.api_responses import APIResponse
```

### Step 4: Replace violations
See MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md for patterns

### Step 5: Re-test
```bash
python3 tests/test_error_message_compliance.py
```

### Step 6: Check off this file above! âœ…

## Time Estimates

- **Easy files (ðŸŸ¢)**: 5-10 min each â†’ ~30 min total
- **Medium files (ðŸŸ¡)**: 10-20 min each â†’ 1-2 hours total  
- **Large files (ðŸ”´)**: 30-60 min each â†’ 2-3 hours total
- **Remaining files**: 5-15 min each â†’ 2-3 hours total

**Total estimated time**: 5-8 hours (or 1-2 weeks doing 5-10 files per day)

## Celebration Milestones ðŸŽ‰

- [ ] **First file complete!** (Timers - easiest)
- [ ] **10 files done** (~40% complete)
- [ ] **All easy files done** (Good momentum!)
- [ ] **All medium files done** (You're crushing it!)
- [ ] **100 violations fixed** (More than halfway!)
- [ ] **All large files done** (Home stretch!)
- [ ] **< 50 violations remaining** (Almost there!)
- [ ] **< 10 violations remaining** (So close!)
- [ ] **ALL VIOLATIONS FIXED!** ðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰ðŸš€

## Tips

### Go Fastest By:
1. Start with EASY files (quick wins, build momentum)
2. Do similar files together (batch context)
3. Use find & replace for repetitive patterns
4. Take breaks between large files

### Avoid Burnout:
- Don't try to do it all in one sitting
- Celebrate small wins
- 5-10 files per day is plenty
- The system prevents new violations, so no rush!

### Get Help:
- See MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md for complete examples
- Check error_messages.py for existing messages
- Run tests frequently to see progress
