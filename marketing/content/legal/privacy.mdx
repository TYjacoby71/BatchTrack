# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how BatchTrack ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our services (the "Service").

We designed BatchTrack to minimize personally identifiable information while giving you full visibility into production data (inventory, recipes, batches, and product metrics). We do not collect social media handles, do not use social logins, and do not sell personal data.

If you are in the EEA/UK, we act as (a) Controller for account-level data (e.g., your email) and (b) Processor for workspace data you enter (e.g., inventory, recipes, batch history), with you as the Controller of that workspace data. For California residents, this Policy incorporates disclosures required by the CCPA/CPRA.

> Template notice: This Policy is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You should have a qualified attorney review and adapt it for your business and jurisdiction.

## Information we collect

### 1) Account Data (Controller)
- Email address
- Password (hashed)
- Organization name and metadata
- Billing contact details (if provided)

### 2) Maker Profile Data (Controller)
- Business category and maker type
- Product categories you produce
- Team roles and permissions

### 3) Workspace Data (Processor)
- Inventory items (names, categories, units, costs, suppliers)
- Packaging items (containers, lids, labels, etc.)
- Recipes and versions
- Batches (planned and actuals), products created, yields
- Ingredients usage totals and event logs
- Notes and attachments you upload

### 4) Integrations Data (Controller for connection metadata; Processor for synced business data)
- Shopify: shop domain, app install status, OAuth tokens/keys, configured scopes; synced objects as configured by you (e.g., products, variants, inventory levels, orders metadata necessary for stock and COGS sync), and inbound webhook events

### 5) Usage, Device, and Diagnostic Data (Controller)
- App telemetry and event analytics (pages, clicks, feature usage)
- Device information, approximate location (derived from IP), timestamps
- Log data for reliability and security (errors, performance metrics)

### 6) Production Analytics and Derived Metrics (Controller)
- Event‑level and aggregated analytics about inventory, recipes, batches, products, and ingredients usage
- Derived metrics for efficiency, yields, containment/fill, and COGS
- Benchmarking and trend analyses that may combine anonymized or de‑identified data across customers

### 7) Cookies and Similar Technologies
- Strictly necessary cookies for authentication and settings
- Optional analytics (privacy‑friendly). We do not use social pixels or cross‑site tracking beacons

## What we do NOT collect
- Social media handles or social logins
- Advertising identifiers for behavioral ads
- Sensitive personal data (e.g., health, biometric, precise geolocation) — do not submit such data to the Service
- Payment card numbers (handled by our payment processor)
- Shopify end‑customer personal data beyond what you explicitly enable and what is necessary for inventory/COGS synchronization

## How we use information
- Provide, operate, secure, and troubleshoot the Service
- Maintain accurate inventory, cost, batching, and product metrics
- Analyze usage to improve features and reduce cognitive load
- Communicate service updates and respond to support requests
- Comply with law, prevent fraud, and ensure platform integrity
- Develop, test, and improve algorithms and insights (including aggregate, anonymized benchmarks). We do not use your data for targeted advertising.

## Your choices and controls
- Marketing communications: you can opt out of marketing emails via unsubscribe links. Transactional emails (security, billing, critical updates) will still be sent.
- Analytics: core operational telemetry is required to provide and secure the Service. Where optional analytics are available, you may disable them in settings (if provided) without impacting core functionality.

## Legal bases (EEA/UK)
- Performance of a contract (to provide the Service)
- Legitimate interests (security, analytics, product improvement)
- Consent (marketing communications where required)

## Sharing and processors
We share data with service providers under data protection agreements, only as needed to operate the Service:
- Hosting and infrastructure (e.g., cloud platform)
- Database/storage and backups
- Email and customer communications
- Analytics/telemetry (without social tracking)
- Error monitoring and logging
- Optional integrations you enable (e.g., Shopify)

We do not sell personal data. We do not allow processors to use your data for their own advertising.

## Data retention
- Account and workspace data: retained for your active subscription and deleted or anonymized within a reasonable period after closure
- Logs/telemetry: typically 12–24 months for security and reliability
- Integration tokens/webhooks: retained while the integration is active and deleted on disconnect

## International data transfers
If data is transferred internationally, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses). Storage regions and subprocessors are listed in our Trust page (or will be upon launch).

## Your rights
Subject to your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, or restrict processing of your personal data. You can also object to processing based on legitimate interests and withdraw consent at any time where applicable. Contact us to exercise these rights.

## California disclosures (CCPA/CPRA)
We collect the categories described above for business purposes (operating the Service, security, analytics, customer support). We do not sell or share personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising. You may exercise your rights to know, delete, correct, and limit use of sensitive information by contacting us.

## Security
We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect data, including encryption in transit, access controls, and audit logging. No system is perfectly secure.

## Children
The Service is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Changes
We may update this Policy. We will update the “Effective Date” and, where required, notify you.

## Contact and Controller
Controller: [Your Company Name], [Address], [City, State, Country]
Email: privacy@[yourdomain].com

If you are a user whose workspace is managed by an organization, that organization controls the workspace data; direct requests regarding workspace content to your organization’s administrator.
