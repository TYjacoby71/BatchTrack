# Built by a maker, for makers

BatchTrack started as a bench‑side tool to tame inventory, recipes, and batches for a small soap studio. It grew into a calmer way for makers to plan, produce, and ship with confidence.

## What we believe

- Tools should lower cognitive load
- Clear flows beat complex dashboards
- Data should be reusable and trustworthy
- Makers deserve software that respects their time

## The mission

Design an opinionated, gentle system that makes production reliable—without requiring spreadsheets or constant mental conversions.

## A note from the founder

“I built BatchTrack to get out of my own head while producing. If it helps you do the same, it’s working.”

## Roadmap (teaser)

- Better insights for efficiency
- Optional sharing via Whop (recipes marketplace)
- Team roles and multi‑location support
