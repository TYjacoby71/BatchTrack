# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide takes you from a fresh account to your first finished batch and product in five calm steps.

## 1) Create your Organization

Create your organization with a clear name. Add your default location if you have more than one.

Outcome: your workspace is ready and scoped for inventory and production.

## 2) Add your first Inventory Items

Use the Global Item Library to avoid re‑typing common materials. Search first; if an item exists, reuse it and adjust packaging or supplier details. If not, create a clean, singular item with unit and cost.

Tips:
- Pick a canonical unit (e.g., grams, milliliters) and let conversions handle the rest.
- Add both ingredients and packaging now; you will need both in recipes.

## 3) Create your first Recipe

Add ingredients and packaging. Choose the Portioning mode:

- Container‑defined: outputs are defined by the container size (e.g., 8oz candles).
- Portioned: outputs are counted by unit (e.g., 24 soap bars from a slab).

Enter target yield, notes, and any process steps. Save version 1.

## 4) Plan your first Batch

Open the recipe and click Start Batch. Set batch size or number of units. BatchTrack scales amounts while preserving ratios and costs.

Check inventory impact and confirm any low‑stock warnings.

## 5) Finish the Batch and see your Product

Record actuals if needed (wastage, substitutions). Finish the batch to create products with calculated COGS. Your inventory updates automatically.

You now have history, costs, and units ready to sell.
