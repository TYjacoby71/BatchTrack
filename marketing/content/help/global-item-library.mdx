# Global Item Library

The library prevents duplicates and keeps units, costs, and names consistent.

## How it works

Search before creating new. If an item exists, reuse it and add packaging sizes or suppliers as needed. New items should have a canonical unit and cost per unit.

## Benefits

- Cleaner recipes and fewer conversion errors
- Easier cost updates across the board
- Faster onboarding for teammates

## Example

“Soy Wax 464” exists with grams as the unit. You can purchase by kg or lb; conversions keep recipes consistent.
