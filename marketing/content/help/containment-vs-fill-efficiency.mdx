# Containment vs. Fill Efficiency

These metrics help explain where material goes, so you can improve yield.

## Definitions

- Containment efficiency: how much produced mass ends up in containers versus spills, residue, or trim.
- Fill efficiency: how close each container gets to its intended fill level.

## Example

20 jars at 8oz each should hold 160oz. If you poured 158oz into jars, containment is 98.75%. If average fill is 7.8oz, fill efficiency is 97.5%.

## Improving efficiency

- Pre‑warm containers to reduce viscosity issues
- Use calibrated scoops and scales
- Adjust target overage based on history
