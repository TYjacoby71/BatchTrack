# BatchTrack Commonly Asked Questions

This CAQ mirrors the internal documentation but is written for anyone evaluating or already using BatchTrack. Each answer links back to the instruction guide for deeper dives.

## Access & Environment

### What should I do right after signup?
Follow the [First Login Checklist](/help/system-instructions#first-login) to choose whether you add inventory or recipes first and see the guided CTAs on the blank dashboard.

### How do I bootstrap BatchTrack locally or reset my database?
See [Provision & Seed the Workspace](/help/system-instructions#provision-and-seed) for the exact install and seeding commands.

### Why can’t my developer account see customer data?
Developers operate outside organizations by design. Review [Manage Organizations, Roles, and Permissions](/help/system-instructions#organizations-and-permissions) to see how developer masquerading works.

## Inventory & Global Library

### How do I add inventory into the system?
Follow the walkthrough under [Add Inventory](/help/system-instructions#add-inventory) to lock identity data, capture stock levels, and keep FIFO history clean.

### Where do densities and default units come from?
They originate in the curated global library. Learn how seeding, metadata, and developer audits work in [Curate the Global Item Library](/help/system-instructions#global-library).

### How do I keep inventory identity locked once it’s tied to a global item?
When you create inventory from a library template, identity fields become read-only. Details live under [Create Inventory from Global Templates](/help/system-instructions#inventory-creation).

### Can I bulk-update metadata for new library items?
Yes—metadata is generated automatically on insert/update, and you can run the refresh script for legacy data. See [Curate the Global Item Library](/help/system-instructions#global-library).

## Recipes, Planning, and Batches

### How do I create a recipe or formulation?
Use the step-by-step flow in [Create a Recipe](/help/system-instructions#add-recipe) to define ingredients, consumables, containers, and category data.

### What protects in-progress batches when recipes change later?
The PlanSnapshot freezes everything at plan time. Read [Plan Production with PlanSnapshot](/help/system-instructions#plan-snapshot).

### How do I scale recipes and start batches without double-deducting inventory?
Follow the flow in [Start, Monitor, and Finish Batches](/help/system-instructions#batches). FIFO deductions and batch rows are created exactly once.

### How do I plan production and kick off a batch run?
See [Plan & Start Production](/help/system-instructions#plan-production) for the exact screen flow from stock check to batch start.

### How do I use intermediate ingredients or configure containers during planning?
Check the [Plan Config Options](/help/system-instructions#plan-config) section for intermediate batches, product outputs, and container auto-selection behavior.

### Where do portioning rules and container selections live?
They’re stored inside the PlanSnapshot and referenced when batches start. See [Plan Production with PlanSnapshot](/help/system-instructions#plan-snapshot).

### What does the batch in-progress page offer?
The full breakdown of timers, extras, costing, and notes lives under [Batch In-Progress Page](/help/system-instructions#batch-in-progress).

### What happens when I finish, cancel, or fail a batch?
Review [Finish, Cancel, or Fail](/help/system-instructions#finish-batch) for how each choice affects deductions and outputs.

## Inventory Control & Alerts

### What’s the proper way to restock, spoil, or adjust lots?
Always route through the Inventory Adjustment Service. Step-by-step guidance is in [Restock, Deduct, and Audit Inventory](/help/system-instructions#inventory-adjustments).

### How are expiration warnings surfaced on the dashboard?
Expiration, reservation, and inventory alerts roll up through the services outlined in [Track Expiration, Alerts, and Reservations](/help/system-instructions#alerts).

### Can I reserve finished goods for specific customers?
Yes, via the Reservation Service and product workflows in [Manage Products, SKUs, and Outputs](/help/system-instructions#products).

### How do I manage product variations (sizes, scents, bundles)?
Use the instructions in [Create Product Variants](/help/system-instructions#product-variants) to add variants, map ingredients, and tie batches to finished SKUs.

### How do SKUs connect to Shopify or other sales systems?
See [SKUs & Sales System Hooks](/help/system-instructions#skus) for external IDs and sync behavior.

## Public Surface & Integrations

### How can anonymous users prep recipes before they sign up?
Public calculators store drafts that auto-load post-login. See [Use Public Tools, Drafts, and Exports](/help/system-instructions#public-tools).

### Which APIs are open without authentication?
Only unit listings, unit conversion, and global-item search. Everything else requires login. Details sit in [Integrate via APIs & Webhooks](/help/system-instructions#api).

### How do I share label or INCI exports with vendors?
Leverage the `/exports/...` routes described in [Use Public Tools, Drafts, and Exports](/help/system-instructions#public-tools).

## Billing & Operations

### What limits the number of active users per organization?
Billing snapshots synced from Stripe enforce tier limits and available permissions—see [Billing, Tiers, and Feature Flags](/help/system-instructions#billing).

### How should I roll out schema changes safely?
Follow the migration + monitoring checklist under [Deployments, Migrations, and Monitoring](/help/system-instructions#devops).

### Where do I log launches, changes, or regressions?
Use the changelog + docs directories referenced in [Deployments, Migrations, and Monitoring](/help/system-instructions#devops) so both public and internal surfaces stay in sync.
