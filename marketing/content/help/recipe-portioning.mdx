# Recipe Portioning

Portioning controls how a recipe defines its outputs.

## Modes

- Container‑defined: outputs are dictated by the container size and count (e.g., 8oz candle in 20 jars).
- Portioned: outputs are counted as discrete units from a bulk mass (e.g., 48 soap bars cut from a loaf).

## Example

Soap Loaf: Set Portioned. Target 24 bars per loaf; BatchTrack calculates batch mass and COGS per bar.

## Tips

- Switch modes per recipe—there’s no global setting.
- Keep target yield realistic; record actuals at finish for better efficiency tracking.
