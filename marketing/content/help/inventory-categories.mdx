# Inventory Categories

Inventory is grouped so costs and usage are accurate and predictable.

## Core categories

- Ingredients: raw materials consumed in recipes (oils, wax, fragrance).
- Packaging: containers, lids, labels, boxes counted into COGS.
- Consumables: shop supplies not directly in COGS (gloves, towels).
- Finished Goods: saleable products created by finishing a batch.

## Example

8oz Candle: wax and fragrance are Ingredients, jar and lid are Packaging, warning label is Packaging, alcohol wipes are Consumables, the finished 8oz Candle is a Finished Good.

## Common pitfalls

- Mixing consumables into ingredient costs hides true margins.
- Duplicating the same item with different units increases errors—prefer one canonical unit with conversions.
