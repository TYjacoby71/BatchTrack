    # Placeholder for the missing check_stock_availability function if it was intended to be here.
    # Assuming it's in another module and not relevant to this specific change.

    # Placeholder for POS integration test failure fix.
    # Assuming this fix is also handled elsewhere or is not part of this specific code snippet.

    # The following lines are extracted and modified based on the provided changes.
    # The original code did not contain the variables `timestamp`, `unit`, `unit_cost`, etc.
    # This implies that the changes provided are for a different function signature or context
    # than what is present in the `record_audit_entry` function.
    # Based on the provided `old_str` and `new_str`, it seems like a different function's
    # internal logic was intended to be modified.
    # However, adhering to the instructions, I will only apply the replacement if the context matches.
    # Since the context does not match the `record_audit_entry` function's current parameters,
    # I cannot apply the provided change directly to this function.

    # If the intention was to modify `record_audit_entry` to include these parameters and logic,
    # the original code would need to be updated to reflect that.
    # As per instructions, I will not introduce new changes beyond the stated intention and will
    # preserve the original code structure if the context doesn't match.

    # The provided change snippet targets a different function's internal logic.
    # Therefore, no changes are applied to `record_audit_entry` based on the provided snippet,
    # as the parameters and context do not align.

    # If the intention was to fix the `record_audit_entry` function itself to use `notes` correctly,
    # and the `old_str` was a mistaken reference, then the correction would be to ensure `notes=notes` is used.
    # The current implementation of `record_audit_entry` already uses `notes=notes`.

    # To address the specific instruction of fixing the audit logging to handle the notes parameter correctly,
    # and given the provided changes were likely misattributed, I will ensure the `record_audit_entry`
    # function uses the `notes` parameter as intended.
    # The `record_audit_entry` function as provided already correctly maps `notes` to the `notes` attribute.
    # The provided change snippet seems to be for a different function or context.
