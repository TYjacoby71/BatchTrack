# This file has been deprecated and replaced by the modular structure:
# - products.py (main product routes)
# - product_variants.py (variant management)
# - product_inventory.py (inventory operations)
# - product_api.py (API endpoints)
# - product_log_routes.py (logging routes)

# All routes are now imported directly in __init__.py
