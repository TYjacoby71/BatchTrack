# BatchTrack

**Multi-tenant production and inventory management for small-batch makers**

BatchTrack helps soap makers, candle makers, and other artisans track recipes, manage batches, and maintain FIFO inventory while scaling from single-user to multi-tenant SaaS.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
flask db upgrade

# Seed all essential data (recommended for new installations)
flask init-production

# OR seed components individually:
# flask seed-permissions
# flask seed-sub-tiers  
# flask seed-units
# flask seed-users

# Run the application
python run.py
```

## üéØ Core Mission

**For:** Small-batch makers who need robust batch tracking without enterprise complexity
**Goal:** Clean, guided workflows for non-technical users with scalable SaaS backend
**Authority:** Service-based architecture where each service has single responsibility

## üìã Key Features

- **Batch Management**: Start, track, and finish production batches with QR codes
- **FIFO Inventory**: Automatic first-in-first-out inventory deduction
- **Multi-tenant Organizations**: Subscription-based user management
- **Recipe Scaling**: Dynamic ingredient calculations with unit conversions
- **Expiration Tracking**: Automatic shelf-life management and alerts
- **Product Management**: SKU generation and sales tracking

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Service Authority (Never Bypass)
- **FIFO Service**: Authoritative for all inventory deductions
- **Inventory Adjustment Service**: Single source of truth for inventory changes
- **Unit Conversion Service**: Handles all unit conversions
- **Stock Check Service**: Real-time availability validation
- **Expiration Service**: Shelf-life calculations and alerts

### Data Scoping
- **Multi-tenant**: All data scoped by `organization_id`
- **Developer Users**: Live outside organizations, system-wide access
- **Subscription Tiers**: Control available features and user limits

## üîí Development Guardrails

1. **NEVER bypass services** - All inventory changes must go through proper services
2. **ALWAYS scope by organization** - Filter by `organization_id` unless you're a developer  
3. **NO hardcoded permissions** - Use `has_permission(user, permission_name)`
4. **Follow service authority** - Each service owns its domain completely
5. **Reference FIFO lots consistently** - Use `fifo_code` (never just ID)
6. **Use drawers for user-fixable errors** - Return `drawer_payload` instead of hard-blocking
7. **Respect Global-Locked identity** - Do not mutate identity on items linked to `GlobalItem`
8. **Update docs when adding services** - Maintain documentation accuracy
