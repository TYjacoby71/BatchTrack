It is similar in properties and uses to coconut oil but is considered to be lighter and less greasy on the skin. It is commonly used in the formulation of skincare and haircare products, as well as in the production of soaps and candles. Babassu oil is known for its moisturizing properties and its ability to provide a smooth, silky texture to formulations.",
