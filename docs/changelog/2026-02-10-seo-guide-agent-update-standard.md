# 2026-02-10 — SEO Guide: Agent Update Standard Clarification

## Summary
- Added a dictionary-style **Update Standard (Agent Instructions)** section to `docs/system/SEO_GUIDE.md`.
- Clarified that the SEO guide is implementation guidance and should not be edited during normal feature pushes unless standards are intentionally changing.
- Added a practical metadata checklist for routes/templates before push.

## Problems Solved
- SEO guidance was descriptive but did not start with a concise, execution-focused instruction block like APP_DICTIONARY.
- Contributors could misinterpret whether to edit the guide vs apply the guide during routine metadata work.

## Key Changes
- `docs/system/SEO_GUIDE.md`
  - Added `Synopsis` section.
  - Added `Update Standard (Agent Instructions)` section with explicit step-by-step metadata requirements.
  - Bumped version from `1.1` to `1.2`.

## Impact
- Metadata updates now have a clear, repeatable implementation standard.
- Reduced ambiguity for future route/template edits and PR checklist compliance.

## Files Modified
- `docs/system/SEO_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG_INDEX.md`
- `docs/changelog/2026-02-10-seo-guide-agent-update-standard.md` (this file)
