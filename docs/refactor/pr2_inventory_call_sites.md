# PR2 Inventory Call Sites Analysis

## Goal
Map every place inventory is adjusted or FIFO math is called to ensure canonicalization through `app/services/inventory_adjustment.py`.

## Current Canonical Service
‚úÖ **Primary Entry Point**: `app/services/inventory_adjustment.py::process_inventory_adjustment()`
- This function is already positioned as the canonical entry point
- Contains comprehensive FIFO logic, validation, and audit trails
- Has backwards compatibility shims

## Call Site Analysis

### 1. Direct Canonical Service Usage (‚úÖ GOOD)

**Batch Operations:**
- `app/blueprints/batches/finish_batch.py` - Uses `process_inventory_adjustment()` for intermediate ingredients and product creation
- `app/blueprints/batches/add_extra.py` - Uses `process_inventory_adjustment()` for extra ingredients and containers
- `app/blueprints/batches/start_batch.py` - Uses `process_inventory_adjustment()` for ingredient/container deductions
- `app/blueprints/batches/cancel_batch.py` - Uses centralized restoration (references canonical service)

**Service Layer:**
- `app/services/inventory_adjustment.py` - Contains the canonical implementation

### 2. Legacy Compatibility Shims (üü° NEEDS CLEANUP)

**FIFO Service Backwards Compatibility:**
- `app/blueprints/fifo/services.py::FIFOService.deduct_fifo()` - Shim that delegates to `process_inventory_adjustment()`
- `app/services/inventory_adjustment.py::InventoryAdjustmentService` - Backwards compatibility class

### 3. Internal FIFO Operations (‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE - INTERNAL ONLY)

**Within Canonical Service:**
- `app/blueprints/fifo/services.py::_FIFOService` - Internal implementation used BY the canonical service
- These are properly encapsulated and not called directly from routes

### 4. Potential Direct Calls (üî¥ NEEDS INVESTIGATION)

**Routes/Templates:**
- Need to grep for any remaining direct FIFO calls from route handlers
- Need to check if any templates or JavaScript makes direct API calls that bypass canonical service

## Raw Grep Analysis

### Inventory Adjustment Calls
```bash
rg -n "adjust|inventory_adjust|fifo|deduct|consume" app | sort
```

### FIFO Imports
```bash
rg -n "from .*fifo" app | sort  
```

### Canonical Service Usage
```bash
rg -n "inventory_adjustment" app | sort
```

## Analysis Summary

### ‚úÖ ALREADY GOOD
- Batch operations properly use `process_inventory_adjustment()`
- Clear canonical entry point exists
- Backwards compatibility shims in place

### üü° CLEANUP NEEDED
- `app/blueprints/batches/finish_batch.py` imports `FIFOService` but should only use canonical service
- Legacy shims can be removed after ensuring no external dependencies

### üî¥ INVESTIGATION NEEDED
- Check if any route handlers directly manipulate inventory without going through canonical service
- Verify JavaScript/AJAX calls use proper endpoints that delegate to canonical service
- Ensure no templates bypass the service layer

## Next Steps for PR2
1. Remove direct `FIFOService` import from `finish_batch.py` 
2. Remove legacy compatibility shims after confirming no external usage
3. Add route ‚Üí service wiring tests
4. Update greps to confirm canonicalization complete
