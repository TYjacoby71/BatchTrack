## 2) Product QA Checklists

### 2.1 Custom Unit & Mapping ‚Äì Launch Checklist

- [ ] `CustomUnitMapping` fully functional with user_id support
- [ ] Density assignment via mapping prompt (optional)
- [ ] Recipe editor blocks unmapped units
- [ ] Stock check blocks:
  - [ ] Unmapped units
  - [ ] Cross-type units without density

- [ ] Supports `used_for_batch_id` traceability
- [ ] InventoryItem `quantity` reflects stock; `cost_per_unit` reflects last purchase; supports `low_stock_threshold`

#### Cost Calculations
- [ ] True cost per unit = total_purchase_cost / (units_used + units_remaining)
- [ ] Exclude spoiled/trash from denominator; compute dynamically (do not store)
- [ ] Spoilage metrics: % lost, total spoilage cost, monthly summary

#### Inventory Display
- [ ] List view shows Effective Cost and Spoiled This Month
