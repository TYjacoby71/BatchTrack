## PRIORITY ORDER
1. ðŸ”´ FIFO Implementation
2. ðŸ”´ Batch Inventory Tracking
3. ðŸŸ¡ Unit Conversion System
4. ðŸŸ¡ Stock Check Service
5. ðŸŸ¢ Container Management

## Current Issues
1. Unit conversion edge cases need testing
2. Container validation needs improvement
3. Stock check service needs centralization
4. Mobile interface needs optimization
5. Production planning UX needs refinement
6. FIFO deduction validation required
7. Batch inventory log display needed
8. Remaining quantity calculation verification needed

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
```python
def test_service_respects_organization_scoping():
```

## Core Business Logic Testing

### FIFO Inventory System
- [ ] FIFO deduction maintains proper chronological order
- [ ] Lot tracking preserves complete audit trail
- [ ] Cross-model FIFO works for both ingredients and products
- [ ] Expiration date handling prevents expired inventory usage
- [ ] Partial lot consumption updates quantities correctly

## Service Architecture Validation

### Service Authority Compliance
- [ ] All inventory changes go through InventoryAdjustmentService
- [ ] All FIFO operations use FIFOService exclusively
- [ ] No direct model manipulation bypasses service layer
- [ ] Unit conversions always use UnitConversionService
- [ ] Stock checks use centralized StockCheckService

### Service Boundary Testing
- [ ] Services don't directly access other service's data
- [ ] Each service maintains single responsibility
- [ ] Service interfaces are clean and well-defined
- [ ] Cross-service communication uses proper patterns

## API Consistency Testing

### Response Format Consistency
- [ ] All API endpoints return consistent JSON structure
- [ ] Error responses follow standardized format
- [ ] Success responses include proper status codes
- [ ] Pagination follows consistent pattern across endpoints

### Error Handling Consistency
- [ ] All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Validation errors include field-specific details
- [ ] System errors are logged but don't expose internals
