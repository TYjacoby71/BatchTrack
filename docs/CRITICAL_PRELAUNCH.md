## üéØ **LAUNCH READINESS CHECKLIST**

### **PHASE 1: Infrastructure (Days 1-2)**
1. Set up Stripe account and create products
2. Configure production database and environment
3. Set up email service and basic templates
4. Deploy to custom domain with SSL

### **PHASE 2: Integration Testing (Days 3-4)**
1. Test complete signup-to-payment flow
2. Verify core business workflows
3. Test multi-tenant data isolation
4. Implement basic error monitoring

### **PHASE 3: Security & Polish (Days 5-6)**
1. Add security hardening features
2. Create legal compliance pages
3. Test error scenarios and edge cases
4. Validate service architecture compliance

### **PHASE 4: Final Validation (Day 7)**
1. End-to-end testing with real payments
2. Multi-device and browser testing
3. Performance and load testing
4. Customer support procedures ready

## üö´ **LAUNCH BLOCKERS STATUS**

### **üî¥ CRITICAL MISSING (Cannot Launch)**
- Stripe integration (0% complete)
- Email verification system (0% complete)
- Production environment setup (0% complete)
- Legal compliance pages (0% complete)

### **üü° PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION (Launch Risk)**
- Security hardening (30% complete)
- Error monitoring (20% complete)
- API consistency (60% complete)

### **üü¢ READY FOR LAUNCH**
- Core business logic (90% complete)
- Multi-tenant architecture (95% complete)
- FIFO inventory system (90% complete)
- Permission system (85% complete)

## ‚è±Ô∏è **REALISTIC TIMELINE: 10-14 DAYS**

Current implementation is approximately **35% launch-ready**. The missing critical infrastructure components (Stripe, email, production setup) require significant setup time beyond basic coding.

**Recommendation**: Plan for 10-14 day timeline to safely address all launch blockers and critical requirements.
