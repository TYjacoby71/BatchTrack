You are 100% right to push back on that. My apologies. "Replace the entire file" was the wrong instruction. It's aggressive, and it throws away the work and logic that's already there.
You are correct. We should modify, not replace.
Let's do this the right way: a surgical, step-by-step modification of your existing _core.py file to transform it into the pure dispatcher that you correctly architected. This will be a much safer and clearer process.
The "True North": The Core Service Must Delegate
Our goal is simple: process_inventory_adjustment should not do any work itself. It should only be a smart dispatcher that receives a request and immediately routes it to the correct specialist (_creation_logic, _recount_logic, _fifo_ops).
The Surgical Fixes for _core.py and Your Tests
Let's make the minimal, necessary changes to achieve our goal and fix the tests.
Step 1: The Dispatcher's "Brain" - Add the Initial Stock Check
The very first thing the dispatcher needs to do is figure out if this is a brand new item.
File to Edit: app/services/inventory_adjustment/_core.py
Action: At the beginning of your process_inventory_adjustment function, add these two lines:
code
Python
def process_inventory_adjustment(item_id, change_type, quantity, **kwargs):
    item = db.session.get(InventoryItem, item_id)
    if not item:
        return False, "Inventory item not found."

    # --- ADD THIS LOGIC ---
    # This is the brain. It checks if any history exists for this item.
    is_initial_stock = UnifiedInventoryHistory.query.filter_by(inventory_item_id=item.id).count() == 0
    # --- END OF ADDITION ---
    
    # ... (rest of your existing function) ...
Step 2: The Dispatcher's "Routing" - Delegate to the Specialist
Now, use the is_initial_stock variable to route the request.
File to Edit: app/services/inventory_adjustment/_core.py
Action: Wrap your existing logic in an if/else block that delegates the initial stock case.
code
Python
def process_inventory_adjustment(item_id, change_type, quantity, **kwargs):
    # ... (the code from Step 1) ...
    is_initial_stock = ...

    # --- WRAP YOUR EXISTING LOGIC IN THIS BLOCK ---
    if is_initial_stock:
        # If it's the first entry, we MUST delegate to the creation specialist.
        # This specialist will handle creating the first audit entry.
        from ._creation_logic import handle_initial_stock
        return handle_initial_stock(item, quantity, change_type=change_type, **kwargs)
    else:
        # If it's NOT initial stock, then proceed with all your
        # existing logic for recounts, fifo deductions, etc.
        # This is where the rest of your current function's code goes.
        if change_type == 'recount':
            # ... your recount logic ...
        elif quantity > 0:
            # ... your fifo addition logic ...
        # ... etc. ...
    # --- END OF WRAPPER ---
Step 3: The Critical Bug Fix - Standardize ALL Return Values
This is the most important change. It will fix the TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable bool object.
File to Edit: app/services/inventory_adjustment/_core.py
Action: Search through the entire process_inventory_adjustment function for every single return statement. Ensure every one of them returns two values: a boolean and a string.
Example "Before":
code
Python
if some_error:
    return False # BUG!
# ...
return True # BUG!
Example "After":
code
Python
if some_error:
    return False, "Something specific went wrong." # CORRECT!
# ...
return True, "Adjustment was successful." # CORRECT!
This single change will fix the recount test failure.
Step 4: Create the Specialist and Fix the Final Test
Now we just need to create the handle_initial_stock function that our dispatcher is trying to call, and fix the one remaining test that has a database context error.
Action A: Create the Specialist
File to Edit: app/services/inventory_adjustment/_creation_logic.py
Action: Add this new function to the file.
code
Python
from ._audit import record_audit_entry
from ._fifo_ops import add_to_fifo

def handle_initial_stock(item, quantity, change_type, **kwargs):
    """Handles the special case for an item's very first stock entry."""
    notes = kwargs.get('notes', 'Initial stock entry.')

    if quantity == 0:
        record_audit_entry(
            item_id=item.id, change_type='initial_stock', quantity_change=0,
            notes='Item created with zero initial stock.', **kwargs
        )
        return True, "Item initialized with zero stock."
    
    # For non-zero initial entries, use the standard add_to_fifo function
    # to ensure consistency in creating the first lot.
    return add_to_fifo(item, quantity, 'initial_stock', **kwargs)
Action B: Fix the Test Context
File to Edit: tests/test_inventory_routes_canonicalization.py
code
Python
# In test_adjust_inventory_initial_stock_calls_canonical_service

# Change this:
with app.test_request_context():

# To this:
with app.app_context():
This surgical approach respects your existing code. It makes the absolute minimum number of changes required to implement the correct "dispatcher" architecture and fix the specific bugs the tests have found. This is the safe, final path to a green test suite.
