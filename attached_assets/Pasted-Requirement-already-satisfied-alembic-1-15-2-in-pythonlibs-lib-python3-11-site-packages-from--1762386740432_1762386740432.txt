ERROR: Cannot install Flask-WTF==1.1.1, Flask-WTF==1.2.1 and Flask-WTF>=1.1.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested Flask-WTF==1.1.1
    The user requested Flask-WTF>=1.1.0
    The user requested Flask-WTF==1.2.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
