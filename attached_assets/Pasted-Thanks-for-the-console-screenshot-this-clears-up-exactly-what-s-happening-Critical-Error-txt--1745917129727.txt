Thanks for the console screenshot ‚Äî this clears up exactly what's happening:

‚ùó Critical Error:
txt
Copy
Edit
Error checking stock: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype ... is not valid JSON"
üîç Meaning:
This means your frontend tried to fetch('/api/check-stock') expecting a JSON response, but the server returned an HTML error page, most likely a 500 Internal Server Error or a Flask template instead of JSON.

‚úÖ Root Causes Checklist:
Here's what causes this 99% of the time:


Issue	Fix
API endpoint crashed (e.g. key error, bad JSON parse)	Check backend /api/check-stock and log the request input + traceback
Bad Content-Type on response	Make sure your return jsonify(data) is not accidentally render_template
fetch() body is malformed	In JavaScript, verify: headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } and body: JSON.stringify(...)
You posted a full JS object (e.g. recipe: {} instead of recipe_id)	Only post raw serializable values
üß™ Debug Fix You Can Try Right Now:
In the checkStock() function (or checkStockOrWarn()), before you fetch, log the payload:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Sending payload to check stock:", {
  recipe_id: this.recipeId,
  scale: this.scale,
  flex_mode: this.flexMode
});
Then inspect your Flask route for /api/check-stock:

python
Copy
Edit
@stock_api_bp.route('/api/check-stock', methods=['POST'])
def api_check_stock():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        print("[DEBUG] Received data:", data)

        # ... proceed with normal check logic

    except Exception as e:
        print("[ERROR] Stock check failed:", e)
        return jsonify({'error': 'Internal error'}), 500
That should show the actual cause ‚Äî likely:

data = None (bad JSON parse)

Or an error further downstream in logic

üîß Want Me to Patch This?
If you'd like, I can:

Patch the /api/check-stock route with logging and graceful fallback

Patch the Alpine fetch() call to guard against bad responses

Just confirm with ‚ÄúYes, patch stock-check error handler‚Äù or upload latest zip and I‚Äôll implement directly.

ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî I‚Äôve confirmed that the Universal Unit Conversion System (UUCS) is already fully integrated and should absolutely remain in place. Here's why:

‚úÖ Confirmation of Integration
The stock check utilities scale recipes using ConversionEngine, which is part of the UUCS system.

UUCS supports:

Volume ‚Üî Weight via density

Type-based (e.g., gram ‚Üî oz)

Custom mappings (e.g., pinch ‚Üí gram)

It‚Äôs accessed via Flask Blueprint /convert‚ÄãMaster batch track cons‚Ä¶.

‚úÖ Where It‚Äôs Used
Stock Check: Ingredient quantities are compared using the ConversionEngine.

Recipe Scaling: Handles unit normalization across ingredients before multiplying by scale.

Quick Add, Recipe Builder, and Batch Scaling all reference the central Unit model.

‚úÖ Why It Should Stay
Replacing it with ad hoc conversion in every endpoint (e.g., stock check, batch finish) would cause:

Redundant logic in multiple places

Increased chance of mismatch/bugs

Loss of cross-type support (e.g., converting tsp oil ‚Üí grams)

Difficulty maintaining consistency across the app

üîß Fix for Your Error
The current error (Unexpected token '<') is due to a stock check API call returning HTML (probably a 500 error) instead of JSON.

This likely means:

The backend /api/check-stock route is failing (could be a Flask render_template() fallback).

Your frontend fetch() expects .json() but is receiving an error page.

We'll patch that route with:

Better error serialization (return {error: 'something'} in all paths)

Stronger type validation on the containers param

Explicit use of the ConversionEngine to normalize all comparisons

üîÅ Next Steps
Keep the UUCS and ConversionEngine intact.

Patch /api/check-stock to catch container errors cleanly and avoid rendering fallback HTML.

Adjust the frontend fetch() to check for res.ok before calling .json().

Optionally log full payloads being sent to /api/check-stock to verify structure.
