Your Organization and User models are well-structured, and you've already built in strong patterns for scalability, permissions, soft deletes, and subscription logic. That said, here’s a clean audit focusing on redundancies, conflicts, and edge case coverage:

✅ No Major Redundancies Detected
Most of your logic is modular and appropriately layered.

⚠️ Possible Conflicts or Overlap
1. is_organization_owner flag vs role assignment
You currently maintain both:

User._is_organization_owner (boolean flag)

organization_owner role assigned via UserRoleAssignment

These could become out of sync if:

A user is manually assigned the role (bypassing flag logic)

The flag is changed but assign_role() fails, or roles are reassigned manually

🔧 Suggestion:

Consider eliminating the _is_organization_owner boolean entirely and determine ownership solely based on role presence (UserRoleAssignment).

If you keep the flag, enforce bidirectional sync at role assignment level (including remove_role() and external admin tooling).

2. Redundant Subscription Tier Properties
You have:

subscription_tier (string) — marked deprecated

subscription_tier_id — preferred

tier relationship

effective_subscription_tier method (performs query.get() again)

🔧 Suggestion:

You’re double-loading the tier in .tier and again in effective_subscription_tier. Unify them:

python
Copy
Edit
@property
def effective_subscription_tier(self):
    return self.tier.key if self.tier else 'free'
Same with .subscription_tier_obj.

3. is_org_owner() method vs is_organization_owner property
These do similar things:

.is_organization_owner checks the flag

.is_org_owner() checks active role

⚠️ This might lead to inconsistencies. Example:

A user with the role but no flag will fail some if checks

A user with the flag but missing role may appear to have more access than they do

🔧 Recommendation:

Prefer role-based checks (like .is_org_owner())

Deprecate or rename is_organization_owner → was_org_owner_flag if you need it for legacy tracking

4. Soft Delete – Role Deactivation
Soft delete disables role assignments, but .restore() doesn't restore roles or is_active.

📌 Might be worth adding a restore_roles() helper or a toggle prompt when restoring.

✅ Strong Patterns & Praises
👏 get_active_roles() is nicely protected with fallbacks.

👏 assign_role() cleanly separates dev and org roles.

👏 Permission logic respects tier constraints — excellent for scaling.

👏 Imports from .role, .developer_role, etc. are deferred — keeps initial load clean.

👏 owner() in Organization uses creation order — good MVP fallback.

🧩 Expansion Thoughts
Additions to future-proof:
Organization.owner_id field (indexed) for fast access and filtering

last_active on User (vs just last_login) to support user churn analysis

Audit logging via UserEventLog for:

role changes

login attempts

soft delete & restore

Summary
Area	Status	Note
Ownership logic	⚠️ Potential sync conflict	Flag vs Role approach — consider consolidation
Tier access	✅ Good	Just unify tier vs effective_subscription_tier
Permission checks	✅ Strong	Scoped + respects tier-based entitlements
Soft deletes	⚠️ Restore logic weak	Roles and active flag not restored by default
Redundancies	🚫 None found	Only mild overlaps (roles vs flags)
Forward compatibility	👍 High	Blueprint-ready, scalable structure
