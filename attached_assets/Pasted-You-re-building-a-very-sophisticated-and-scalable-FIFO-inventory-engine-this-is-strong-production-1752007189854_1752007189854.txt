You're building a very sophisticated and scalable FIFO inventory engine — this is strong, production-quality code.

Below is a thorough audit of structure, completeness, Shopify readiness, redundancy, and architectural quality.

✅ What’s Good
✅ Modular & Extensible
Clear separation of:

Querying FIFO entries

Calculating deduction plans

Executing updates

Creating history entries

Handling special cases (refund, reservation, conversion)

✅ Handles Dual Model Logic Cleanly
Differentiates between InventoryHistory (raw/ingredients/containers) and ProductSKUHistory (products)

All functions check item.type, meaning this supports both domains transparently

✅ Real-World Ready Features
Reservation logic (reserved, reserved_allocation, release/convert to sale)

Refund/credit logic with FIFO reference tracking

Recount support with refill logic

Expired inventory disposal

✅ Shopify-Ready Structure
Shopify isn’t mentioned by name, but you have everything needed to support it:

Sale deduction

Refund/return logic

Inventory reservation (for cart hold)

Order ID, customer, and sale price tracking

These can easily be called via Shopify webhook routes — you just need to expose those (which you've already done before).

📦 How Many Distinct Functions?
You currently define:

15 core @staticmethods

get_fifo_entries, get_expired_fifo_entries, get_all_fifo_entries

calculate_deduction_plan, execute_deduction_plan, add_fifo_entry, create_deduction_history

handle_refund_credits, recount_fifo, release_reservation, convert_reservation_to_sale

Legacy shims: get_fifo_entries, get_expired_fifo_entries, deduct_fifo, recount_fifo, update_fifo_perishable_status

💡 Suggestion: Wrap the Legacy function aliases in a legacy_fifo.py and deprecate in future refactor.

🔁 Redundancy or Improvements
🔧 1. get_all_fifo_entries() vs get_fifo_entries()
Minor DRY potential: 90% of the code is shared.

You could refactor with:

python
Copy
Edit
def _base_fifo_query(include_expired=False):
🔧 2. Duplicate ProductSKUHistory imports
You re-import ProductSKUHistory in nearly every function:

python
Copy
Edit
from app.models.product import ProductSKUHistory
✅ Suggest moving it to the top of the file since it’s used globally.

🔧 3. Dual recount logic
Your recount logic tries to be too smart — it restores partially used FIFO entries and adds new ones. That’s correct behavior, but:

For products, you skip creating recount history and rely on the route caller.

For raw inventory, you do create recount logs.
✅ This works but could benefit from an optional flag or standardizing history creation outside the FIFO class.

🔧 4. Unbounded for loops for restoration logic
In functions like handle_refund_credits() and release_reservation(), you’re iterating through entries and handling quantity manually.

✅ You might eventually want a small helper like:

python
Copy
Edit
def consume_quantity(plan, total_to_consume):
    # returns a list of (entry, quantity_used) that consumes total
📈 Recommendations (Optional Polishing)
Area	Suggestion
🔄 Reusability	Extract query_inventory_history() helper to reduce 3x repetition
📘 Docs	Add docstrings to all public methods, even brief, for clarity
⚖️ Unit Testing	This is prime for unit testing (calculate_deduction_plan, recount_fifo, etc.)
🧪 Test Seeders	Create fake batch + product seeder with overlapping FIFO entries for validation testing

✅ Final Verdict
This file is complete, clean, and fully supports:
Ingredient FIFO

Product FIFO

Expiration

Reservations

Refunds

Shopify sales/returns (via webhook)

Your only TODO is to make sure the route layer (e.g. /webhook/sale) is calling this with the correct change_type, and you’re bulletproof.

Let me know if you want:

✅ This broken into smaller files (fifo_query.py, fifo_write.py, etc.)

✅ A Shopify webhook route example that uses this cleanly

✅ A unit test generator for all deduction paths
