**BatchTrack QA Checklist (v8.9)**

---

## üåü Overall Goal:
Ensure every function in BatchTrack works in the correct logical order, with no butterfly effect regressions.

This checklist is flow-based, meaning each step builds on the last. If any early step fails, downstream tests should be skipped until fixed.

## üîç QA Flow

### 1. INGREDIENT SETUP
- [ ] Add new ingredient
- [ ] Assign a category (e.g., Oils, Butters)
- [ ] Assign default unit (e.g., grams)
- [ ] Set initial inventory (e.g., 1000g)
- [ ] Set `low_stock_threshold` and test alert
- [ ] Set `is_perishable = True` and save

### 2. UNITS & CONVERSIONS
- [ ] View global unit list
- [ ] Add custom unit (e.g., squirt)
- [ ] Add conversion rate (e.g., squirt to grams)
- [ ] Confirm it's available in ingredient dropdown

### 3. RECIPE CREATION
- [ ] Create a new recipe with at least 3 ingredients
- [ ] Apply correct units and values
- [ ] Scale recipe (1x, 5x, 10x) and confirm output

### 4. INVENTORY UPDATE
- [ ] Zero out an ingredient
- [ ] Bulk update multiple ingredients
- [ ] Verify low stock alert fires

### 5. PLAN PRODUCTION
- [ ] Choose a recipe
- [ ] Apply scale (e.g. 2x)
- [ ] Check inventory status
- [ ] Start batch only if inventory is sufficient

### 6. BATCH IN PROGRESS
- [ ] View recipe details and cost table
- [ ] Add extra ingredients
- [ ] Add notes and tags
- [ ] Use and display timers

### 7. FINISH BATCH
- [ ] Set output: product, variant, size, unit
- [ ] Mark as perishable with expiration date or shelf life
- [ ] Finish and redirect to "View Batch"

### 8. VIEW BATCH
- [ ] Confirm batch ID, product output, quantity
- [ ] Display expiration if set
- [ ] Cost per unit calculation works

### 9. PRODUCT INVENTORY SUMMARY
- [ ] Product grouped by variant + size + unit
- [ ] Quantities match what was produced
- [ ] Click "next batch" opens FIFO breakdown view

### 10. FIFO DEDUCTION
- [ ] Deduct 5 units manually from product page
- [ ] Batches deduct in correct order
- [ ] View updated batch FIFO list

### 11. ALERT DASHBOARD
- [ ] Show low stock warnings
- [ ] Show expired batches
- [ ] Navigate to affected product or batch

### 12. SETTINGS & ADMIN
- [ ] Save settings changes (e.g., toggle a flag)
- [ ] Run cleanup tools with no crash

## üéì Notes:
- Use fresh DB or reset to avoid test pollution
- Run each section only after the one above it passes
- Mark regressions or skipped tests

- [ ] Passed with Warnings
- [ ] Requires Fix Before Launch
