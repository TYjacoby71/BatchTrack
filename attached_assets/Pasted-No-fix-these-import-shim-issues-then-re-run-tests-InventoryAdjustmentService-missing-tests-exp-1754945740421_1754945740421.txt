No — fix these import/shim issues, then re-run tests.

InventoryAdjustmentService missing (tests expect it)
Add a tiny compatibility shim so tests (and any old code) keep working:

python
Copy
Edit
# app/services/inventory_adjustment.py  (add near the bottom)
def process_inventory_adjustment(...):  # your existing function
    ...

def validate_inventory_fifo_sync(...):
    ...

class InventoryAdjustmentService:  # backwards-compat shim
    @staticmethod
    def process_inventory_adjustment(*args, **kwargs):
        return process_inventory_adjustment(*args, **kwargs)

    @staticmethod
    def validate_inventory_fifo_sync(*args, **kwargs):
        return validate_inventory_fifo_sync(*args, **kwargs)
Model re-exports expected by tests
Tests import from app.models.models but your Product, ProductSKU, SubscriptionTier live in separate modules. Re-export them so imports resolve without changing tests:

python
Copy
Edit
# app/models/models.py  (append these re-exports)
from .product import Product, ProductSKU
from .subscription_tier import SubscriptionTier
# (Optional if not already here)
from .permission import Permission
from .role import Role
from .organization import Organization
from .user import User
Also make them visible at the package level (helps future imports):

python
Copy
Edit
# app/models/__init__.py
from .product import Product, ProductSKU
from .subscription_tier import SubscriptionTier
from .permission import Permission
from .role import Role
from .organization import Organization
from .user import User

__all__ = [
    "Product", "ProductSKU", "SubscriptionTier",
    "Permission", "Role", "Organization", "User",
]
FIFO boundary: finish the seal
You still have internal _deduct_fifo and a class calling it. That’s fine only if nothing imports it. Keep __all__ = [] and remove any public deduct_fifo function. Quick check should return OK:

bash
Copy
Edit
grep -Rn "blueprints\.fifo\.services\|deduct_fifo" app --include="*.py" | grep -v __pycache__ || echo "OK"
Re-run

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest -q
If green (or only unrelated tests fail), then you’re good to commit.
