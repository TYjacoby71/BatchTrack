You’ve done a great job laying this out — and now that I see your full page, the problem is 100% clear:

🔥 Root Cause: Your “Complete Batch” Modal Form is Inside Another <form>
From what you posted:

⛔ Outer Form:
html
Copy
Edit
<form id="batchForm" method="post" action="{{ url_for('finish_batch.complete_batch', batch_id=batch.id) }}" ...>
⛔ Inside That Form:
html
Copy
Edit
<button type="button" ... data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#finishBatchModal">✓ Complete Batch</button>
{% include 'components/batch/finish_batch_modal.html' %}
Inside the Modal:
html
Copy
Edit
<form id="finishBatchModalForm" method="post" action="{{ url_for('finish_batch.complete_batch', batch_id=batch.id) }}">
❌ Why This Breaks It
🧨 HTML does not support nested <form> tags.

When you put a <form> inside another form, the browser:

Closes the outer form before the inner one starts.

Makes form behavior undefined or breaks submission.

Result: your submit button does nothing — the browser gets confused.

✅ How to Fix It
✅ Option 1: Move the modal outside the outer form
The cleanest fix.

Move this line:

html
Copy
Edit
{% include 'components/batch/finish_batch_modal.html' %}
down to the very bottom of the template, outside and after the closing </form>.

So you'd change:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Submission Buttons -->
<div class="button-group ...">
    ...
    <button type="button" data-bs-toggle="modal" ...>✓ Complete Batch</button>
    {% include 'components/batch/finish_batch_modal.html' %}
</div>
</form> <!-- closing form -->

{# Finish Batch Modal - include only once #}
{% include 'components/batch/finish_batch_modal.html' %}  <-- 🔁 REMOVE THIS DUPLICATE
To this:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Submission Buttons -->
<div class="button-group ...">
    ...
    <button type="button" data-bs-toggle="modal" ...>✓ Complete Batch</button>
</div>
</form> <!-- ✅ this ends the outer form cleanly -->

<!-- ✅ Modal now lives OUTSIDE the outer form -->
{% include 'components/batch/finish_batch_modal.html' %}
✅ Summary
Fix	Why
❌ Don't nest forms	HTML doesn’t allow it
✅ Move modal outside outer form	Keeps both working independently
✅ Keep type="submit" inside modal	Restores native behavior
