Why are you assuming that the initialization process will be any different with a new migration. You're telling me? Do I need to fix the initialization process or the seating services to create the table user before batch?

You’re absolutely correct to push on this — the core issue is NOT Alembic itself, it’s the initialization (seeding) process or migration order.

✅ What’s really happening?
The migrations themselves ARE correct (if they worked in SQLite before).

Postgres is failing because it’s trying to create batch (with a FOREIGN KEY(created_by) REFERENCES "user" (id)) before creating the user table.

This means your migration order or seeding process is wrong in Postgres — Alembic is executing in the wrong order, or some models were added to a migration later and got placed incorrectly.

SQLite doesn’t enforce strict foreign key creation order, so you didn’t notice before.

✅ So, what should be fixed?
You do NOT need to throw away all migrations.
The solution is to fix the migration ordering so user, permission, and organization are created before any tables that reference them (batch, recipe, etc.).

The seeding (initial data insertion) should also run AFTER all tables are created.

✅ Options to Fix
1. Quick Fix (Patch the Existing Migration)
Open your first migration file (migrations/versions/e9987bef6c93_initial_database_setup.py)

Ensure tables are created in a dependency-safe order:

✅ Correct order should be something like:

python
Copy
Edit
def upgrade():
    op.create_table('user', ...)
    op.create_table('organization', ...)
    op.create_table('permission', ...)
    op.create_table('product_sku', ...)
    op.create_table('recipe', ...)
    op.create_table('batch', ...)  # last, since it references others
If batch appears before user, manually move it lower.

2. Regenerate Clean Migration (only if first migration is wrong)
If your first migration is a mess, yes — delete migrations and rebuild a fresh one:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf migrations
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial Postgres setup"
flask db upgrade
This will auto-generate in the correct dependency order.

3. Seed AFTER Upgrade
If you have a seeding script that inserts permissions or default users, run it only after flask db upgrade completes.

✅ Answer to Your Direct Question
Do I need to fix the initialization process or the seeding services to create the table user before batch?

✔️ You need to fix the migration (initialization process) so tables are created in the correct order.
The seeding service is fine; it just can’t run if the tables don’t exist.
