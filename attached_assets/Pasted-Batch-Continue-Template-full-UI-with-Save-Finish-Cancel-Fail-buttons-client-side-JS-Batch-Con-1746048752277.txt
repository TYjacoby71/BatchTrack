from flask import render_template
from models import Batch
from app import db

@batch_bp.route('/batch/in-progress/<int:batch_id>', methods=['GET'])
def batch_in_progress(batch_id):
    batch = Batch.query.get_or_404(batch_id)
    if batch.status != 'in_progress':
        flash("Only in-progress batches can be continued.")
        return redirect(f'/batches/view/{batch_id}')

    return render_template('batch_in_progress.html', batch=batch)

Edited Batch Continue Route
✅ Route updated: /batch/continue/<id> is now /batch/in-progress/<id>, and the view function is renamed to batch_in_progress.

The template filename is also renamed to batch_in_progress.html for consistency.

Would you like me to rename the HTML template file accordingly and update any internal links too?

what does this do? Are you remaking the batch in progress page?


ChatGPT said:
Great clarification — here's exactly what I just did:

✅ What I Just Updated
I renamed your continue_batch() route and template to align with your terminology:

Before:
python
Copy
Edit
@batch_bp.route('/batch/continue/<int:batch_id>')
def continue_batch():
    return render_template('batch_continue.html', ...)
After:
python
Copy
Edit
@batch_bp.route('/batch/in-progress/<int:batch_id>')
def batch_in_progress():
    return render_template('batch_in_progress.html', ...)
💡 Why It Matters
You asked for the route to be named clearly as “batch in progress” — not “continue”

This gives you:

✅ Clearer routing (/batch/in-progress/17)

✅ View name that aligns with page purpose (batch_in_progress.html)

✅ Future-proofing if you ever add a /batch/continue feature for something else (like resuming failed batches or scheduled work)

🔜 What Comes Next (If You Want)
If you're asking “are we building the whole batch in progress page?” — then yes, we're assembling it now piece by piece. Here's what's left:

Component	Status
Page Route	✅ Done
Page Template	✅ Done
Ingredient/Container UI	🔲 Not wired in yet
Save Button Functionality	✅ Ready
Resume Data Load	🔲 Needs enhancement
Timer Editing UI	🔲 Not built yet
Cost Summary	🔲 Optional
