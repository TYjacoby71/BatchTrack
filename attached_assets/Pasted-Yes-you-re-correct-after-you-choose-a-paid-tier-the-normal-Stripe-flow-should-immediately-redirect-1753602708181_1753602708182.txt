Yes, you’re correct—after you choose a paid tier, the normal Stripe flow should immediately redirect the user to Stripe Checkout (a hosted payment page) or, if you’re using Stripe Billing portals, to the Customer Portal.

Right now, your system is:

Retrieving pricing perfectly ✅ (Stripe API calls are all good).

Still treating signup as “developer mode” (stripe_mode: False) ❌—which triggers your fallback check that says:

sql
Copy
Edit
Error creating account: All paid subscriptions must be processed through Stripe payment system
Never reaching the actual Stripe Checkout session creation because your signup flow blocks before stripe.checkout.Session.create() is even called.

✅ What Should Happen in the Signup Flow
User fills out signup → selects paid tier.

Backend creates the org & user in a pending state (but does NOT mark as active yet).

Backend calls Stripe Checkout:

python
Copy
Edit
session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    mode="subscription",
    line_items=[{"price": price_id, "quantity": 1}],
    success_url="https://yourdomain.com/billing/complete-signup-from-stripe?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
    cancel_url="https://yourdomain.com/auth/signup?cancelled=true",
    customer_email=email
)
Response redirects user to Stripe-hosted page:

python
Copy
Edit
return redirect(session.url)
On successful payment → Stripe calls your webhook, and/or user lands back on complete-signup-from-stripe route, where you mark the subscription as active.

✅ Why It’s Not Redirecting
Your logs confirm:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Stripe mode: False
So your code is short-circuiting BEFORE hitting Stripe Checkout creation.

This typically happens if:

One of your required Stripe ENV values is still missing:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY ✅ (must be set, which it is because you can call Stripe API)

STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY ✅ (needed for frontend, not mandatory for backend session creation, but your code may require it)

STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET ❌ (likely missing or empty—your is_stripe_ready() logic might treat missing webhook secret as "not ready")

Your "developer fallback" code overrides even when all Stripe keys exist—e.g.:

python
Copy
Edit
if not all([STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET]):
    stripe_mode = False
→ That’s too strict; webhook should not block signup.

✅ What to Do Now
Check is_stripe_ready() or equivalent logic:

Log all three ENV values explicitly to confirm they are not empty or None on Render.

Loosen your Stripe-ready check:

For signup, you only need STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (backend) and STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (frontend).

Webhook secret should NOT block Checkout.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def is_stripe_ready():
    return bool(Config.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and Config.STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY)
Confirm the signup route calls Stripe Checkout session creation when stripe_mode=True.
If you want, I can rewrite your signup_service logic to always:

✅ Create Stripe session for paid plans

✅ Allow free plans to bypass Stripe

✅ Fail gracefully only if Stripe API fails.
