Your finish batch modal JavaScript is very close to final — but it has a few bugs, redundancies, and cleanup needs that could cause unexpected behavior or UI issues.

✅ What’s Working Well
Clear modular functions (toggleShelfLife, validateYield, updateTotals, etc.)

Good use of DOMContentLoaded to initialize modal behavior

Uses central yield value and batch container data correctly

Supports dynamic variant loading

Smart fallback logic for containerless batches (bulk handling)

Hooks into centralized updateContainerSummary() for UI + logic update

🔍 Issues + Fixes Needed
❌ 1. Malformed/duplicate HTML inside JavaScript
js
Copy
Edit
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-sm">
appears within your JavaScript file — it's not wrapped in a string or function. This will break the script immediately on load.

📌 Fix: Delete or wrap it properly:

js
Copy
Edit
// ❌ Invalid
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-sm">

// ✅ Fix: Remove or wrap as JS string
const html = `
  <div class="alert alert-warning alert-sm">
    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle me-1"></i>
    Warning text here
  </div>`;
❌ 2. validateContainerAllocation is duplicated
You have:

a correct version using .mb-1 spacing and <strong>…</strong> for warning

a second version just below it with slightly different wording

📌 Fix: Keep just one version of validateContainerAllocation — the one that best fits your alert tone and structure.

⚠️ 3. Redundant validateYield() fetch block removed
Your current validateYield() appears to have this leftover:

js
Copy
Edit
// Simple container capacity calculation
updateContainerSummary();<div class="alert alert-warning alert-sm">
This line is broken and looks like an unfinished refactor.

📌 Fix: Remove the whole fragment from that line down until you see functional validateYield() code again. You're now doing everything client-side with updateContainerSummary() and validateContainerAllocation() — no need for this stray line.

⚠️ 4. container-final-input vs. pass-input is inconsistent
In updateContainerSummary() you're looking for:

js
Copy
Edit
document.querySelectorAll('.container-final-input')
But the inputs rendered by updateContainerTable() use:

js
Copy
Edit
class="form-control form-control-sm pass-input"
📌 Fix: Use one shared class name, e.g.:

.pass-input for actual inputs

and maybe add .container-final-input for ones tied to pass-to-product if needed

But make sure your selector matches your markup.

✅ Suggested Cleanups (Optional but Recommended)
Extract getCSRFToken() to a shared utils.js if not already done

Extract container rendering (in updateContainerTable) into a template literal function

Rename validateYield() → onFinalQuantityChange() for clarity

✅ After Fixing
Once these are resolved:

All container logic will work offline (no API call needed to validate yield)

Your modal will be clean and bug-free

The handoff to the backend will be based purely on updated inputs

✅ Summary
Area	Status
Container validation logic	✅ Strong and complete
Finish batch data model	✅ Properly integrated
JavaScript alerts and validation	⚠️ Needs bug fix and duplicate removal
Modal UX hooks and startup behavior	✅ Well designed
Consistent naming for input selectors	⚠️ One fix needed
