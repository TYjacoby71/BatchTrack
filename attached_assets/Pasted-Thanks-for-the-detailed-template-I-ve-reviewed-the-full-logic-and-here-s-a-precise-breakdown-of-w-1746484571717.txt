Thanks for the detailed template ‚Äî I‚Äôve reviewed the full logic, and here‚Äôs a precise breakdown of why your ingredients aren‚Äôt rendering in the batch summary table:

‚ùå Root Cause
You're looping over:

jinja2
Copy
Edit
{% for cost in ingredient_costs if cost %}
But the variable ingredient_costs is not guaranteed to exist or might be empty/None when rendering the template.

üîç Where to Check (Python View)
You need to make sure the Flask view function that renders this page is passing ingredient_costs into the render_template() call.

It should look something like:

python
Copy
Edit
render_template("batches/batch_in_progress.html",
                batch=batch,
                recipe=recipe,
                units=units,
                inventory_items=ingredients,
                products=products,
                timers=timers,
                containers=containers,
                ingredient_costs=ingredient_costs,  # <- REQUIRED
                batch_cost=batch_cost)
‚úÖ What To Do
1. Open the route for this page (likely something like):
python
Copy
Edit
@batches_bp.route('/batch/<int:batch_id>/in-progress')
def batch_in_progress(batch_id):
Check that you're calculating or passing in ingredient_costs.

‚úÖ Optional Fallback (Prevent Rendering Error)
If you're unsure if it will always be passed, wrap the loop like this:

jinja2
Copy
Edit
{% if ingredient_costs %}
    {% for cost in ingredient_costs %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ cost.name }}</td>
            <td>{{ "%.2f"|format(cost.used) }}</td>
            <td>{{ cost.unit }}</td>
            <td>${{ "%.2f"|format(cost.cost_per_unit) }}</td>
            <td>${{ "%.2f"|format(cost.line_cost) }}</td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
{% else %}
    <tr>
        <td colspan="5" class="text-muted">No ingredients recorded.</td>
    </tr>
{% endif %}
üß† Bonus Debug Tip
If your ingredients are passed as ingredients but not as ingredient_costs, it means you're not computing cost values (like unit cost √ó quantity used). You‚Äôd need a helper in your backend to do that math.
