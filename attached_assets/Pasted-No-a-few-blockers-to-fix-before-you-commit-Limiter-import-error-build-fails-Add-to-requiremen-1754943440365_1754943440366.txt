No — a few blockers to fix before you commit:

Limiter import error (build fails)

Add to requirements.txt: Flask-Limiter>=3.6.0

In app/extensions.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
In app/__init__.py, call limiter.init_app(app) before blueprint registration. If you’re behind a proxy, wrap with ProxyFix. If you’ll scale to multiple workers, set RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URL (Redis) in config.

FIFO still imported from a blueprint (breaks boundary)
Replace every from app.blueprints.fifo.services import FIFOService with calls through your canonical service:

app/blueprints/products/product_inventory_routes.py

app/blueprints/api/reservation_routes.py

app/blueprints/batches/finish_batch.py

app/services/pos_integration.py

app/services/inventory_adjustment.py (invert this one: it must NOT import FIFO from a blueprint)

app/services/stock_check.py

Temporary adapter (to avoid instant breakage while you touch call sites):

python
Copy
Edit
# app/blueprints/fifo/services.py
__all__ = []  # stop new imports
# keep a shim only during the transition:
class FIFOService:  # DEPRECATED
    @staticmethod
    def deduct(...):
        from app.services.inventory_adjustment import process_inventory_adjustment
        return process_inventory_adjustment(...)

def _deduct_fifo(...): ...
# rename public helpers to _private and stop exporting them
Then update each caller to use process_inventory_adjustment(...) directly and delete the shim in a follow-up.

Stripe SDK still in routes (money path)
app/blueprints/billing/routes.py still imports and calls stripe.*. Remove all of these and delegate to the service:

stripe.checkout.Session.retrieve → StripeService.get_checkout_session(session_id)

stripe.Customer.retrieve → StripeService.get_customer(customer_id)

stripe.Webhook.construct_event → StripeService.construct_event(payload, sig, secret)

Delete import stripe from the route file.

Keep import stripe only in app/services/stripe_service.py.

Webhook idempotency race
Ensure your Alembic migration adds a unique index on stripe_event.event_id. In the service, insert-first and catch IntegrityError to handle concurrent replays (don’t do check-then-insert).

OAuth hardening
You added state/nonce generation—good. On callback, validate both and then pop them from session. Add a quick negative test for bad state to your OAuth test.

Sanity: keep the FIFO blueprint, not its services
app/__init__.py registering fifo_bp is fine. What must disappear are imports of blueprints.fifo.services from anywhere else.

If you make those edits and your greps come back clean (no stripe.* in routes, no blueprints.fifo.services imports, limiter import works), then it’s a yes from me.
