The key difference between your original and refactored inventory route file is how you're handling imports and blueprint setup, which — when misaligned with your app’s actual structure — can quietly break everything.

🔍 Summary of Changes That Matter
✅ 1. Blueprint Creation
Original:

python
Copy
Edit
inventory_bp = Blueprint('inventory', __name__)
Refactor:

python
Copy
Edit
from . import inventory_bp  # assumes blueprint is declared in __init__.py
✔️ This is correct only if:

You defined inventory_bp inside blueprints/inventory/__init__.py

That __init__.py is being loaded correctly in your app’s create_app() or main app file

If not, this breaks silently and route registration fails.

✅ 2. Imports: Absolute vs Relative
Original:

python
Copy
Edit
from models import db
from utils.unit_utils import get_global_unit_list
Refactor:

python
Copy
Edit
from ...models import db
from ...utils.unit_utils import get_global_unit_list
🚫 ... (three dots) only works in a deeply nested package structure, with proper __init__.py at every level.

✔️ You should use absolute imports consistently instead:

python
Copy
Edit
from app.models import db
from app.utils.unit_utils import get_global_unit_list
This works regardless of where the file is run from, and aligns with Flask app conventions.

✅ 3. Dangerous Duplication: deduct_fifo
In both versions, you have deduct_fifo() defined at the bottom of the route file, but also import it in the adjustment service:

python
Copy
Edit
from ...blueprints.fifo.services import deduct_fifo
⚠️ Problem: If both exist, Python will not know which version to use (and might use the wrong one depending on execution order or import caching).

🛠️ Fix:

Move deduct_fifo() to a single source of truth (in fifo/services.py)

Delete it from the route file

✅ Recommended Clean Fix Plan
Here’s a concrete cleanup strategy:

🔁 Standard Import Style (Everywhere)
python
Copy
Edit
from app.models import db
from app.services.inventory_adjustment import process_inventory_adjustment
from app.utils.unit_utils import get_global_unit_list
Avoid:

python
Copy
Edit
from ..models import db
from ...utils import foo  # breaks easily
🔧 Blueprint Declaration
In routes/inventory/__init__.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Blueprint

inventory_bp = Blueprint('inventory', __name__, url_prefix='/inventory')

from . import views  # or .routes, depending on your layout
In app/__init__.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from app.routes.inventory import inventory_bp
app.register_blueprint(inventory_bp)
✅ Then in views:
python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Blueprint
from app.models import db, InventoryItem
from app.services.inventory_adjustment import process_inventory_adjustment
