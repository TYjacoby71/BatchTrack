This is a fantastic question that gets to the heart of the difference between a development project and a professional, maintainable application. Your instinct is spot on: the console is far too noisy, and the way logging is being handled is a problem.
Let's break down your questions with clarity.
Your Question #1: Is the noisy console collected debugging stuff?
Yes. 100%.
The 🔍 prefixed messages, the detailed middleware execution logs, the permission checks—all of this is debug-level logging. Its purpose is to give a developer a highly detailed, step-by-step trace of what the code is doing while they are building or fixing a feature.
It is not meant for a live, production environment.
Your Question #2: Should we only have debugging on for what we are working on?
Yes. Exactly.
In an ideal development workflow, you would have a way to selectively enable and disable verbose logging for the specific module you are focused on. Having every single part of the application scream its status at you all the time is counter-productive. It's like trying to have a quiet conversation in a room where twenty different TVs are blaring. You can't hear the one thing you need to listen to.
Your Question #3: Should debugging live in the app after it's in production?
Absolutely not.
This is the most critical point. In a production environment, your logs should be clean, concise, and focused on providing actionable information. A noisy production log is a massive liability for several reasons:
It Hides Critical Errors: A real, catastrophic error can be buried in thousands of lines of meaningless "🔍 User 123's permissions checked successfully" messages, making it impossible to find and fix the actual problem.
Performance Cost: Writing thousands of log lines to a file or a logging service consumes CPU cycles and I/O. For a high-traffic application, this can have a noticeable impact on performance.
Financial Cost: If you are using a professional logging service (like Datadog, LogRocket, Sentry, etc.), you are almost always paying based on the volume of data you send. Excessive debug logging in production can literally cost you thousands of dollars.
Security Risk: Debug logs can sometimes inadvertently expose sensitive information, like user data, internal variables, or system paths, which could be exploited by an attacker.
The Professional Approach: The Hierarchy of Logging
You should not be manually adding and removing console.log or logger.info statements as you work. The correct approach is to use a structured logging system with different "Log Levels."
Think of it like a volume knob with different settings for different situations. The standard levels are:
DEBUG (Loudest): The super-noisy, step-by-step trace you have now. Should be OFF in production.
INFO: Important, but normal, business events. "User 123 logged in." "Batch #567 was started." Should be ON in production.
WARNING: Something unexpected happened, but the application could recover. "Could not reach the Shopify API, will retry in 5 minutes." Should be ON in production and should trigger an alert for developers.
ERROR: Something has gone seriously wrong, and a user's request has failed. "Failed to save batch to database due to a unique constraint violation." Should be ON in production and should trigger an immediate, high-priority alert (like a PagerDuty notification).
CRITICAL: The entire application is about to crash. "Cannot connect to the primary database." Should be ON and trigger all the alarms.
The Implementation:
Your Flask application should be configured to only log messages above a certain level based on an environment variable.
In your config.py:
code
Python
LOG_LEVEL = os.environ.get('LOG_LEVEL', 'INFO').upper()
When you run in Production: The LOG_LEVEL environment variable is set to INFO. The application will automatically ignore all the logger.debug(...) calls.
When you run in Development: You set FLASK_DEBUG=true or LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG. Now all the noisy, helpful debug messages will appear.
The same principle applies to the frontend. You can create a simple logger utility that wraps console.log and checks a global DEBUG flag.
code
JavaScript
// logger.js
const DEBUG_MODE = true; // Set this based on an environment variable

export const logger = {
    debug: (...args) => {
        if (DEBUG_MODE) {
            console.log('🔍', ...args);
        }
    },
    info: (...args) => console.info(...args),
    warn: (...args) => console.warn(...args),
    error: (...args) => console.error(...args),
};
Then, throughout your code, you would use logger.debug("My noisy message") instead of console.log.
Conclusion:
You are absolutely right. The current state of logging is unsustainable and unprofessional. The correct course of action is to:
Go through the codebase and change all the noisy, development-only log statements from logger.info to logger.debug (in Python) or from console.log to a logger.debug wrapper (in JavaScript).
Configure your application to control the logging level based on the environment.
This will give you a clean, quiet, and professional production environment, while still giving you the power to turn on the detailed firehose of information when you're actively hunting down a bug.
