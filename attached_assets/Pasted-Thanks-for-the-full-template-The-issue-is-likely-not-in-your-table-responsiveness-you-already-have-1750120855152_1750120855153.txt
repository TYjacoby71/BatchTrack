Thanks for the full template. The issue is likely not in your table responsiveness (you already have .table-responsive), but rather in how Bootstrap cards or containers are behaving in relation to the fixed-width content (e.g., long links or tight padding).

Here are the likely causes and fixes to make sure no card content ever overflows horizontally, even with long links, tight table cells, or responsive content.

‚úÖ Final Fix: Apply These 3 Key Adjustments
‚úÖ 1. Ensure the .container doesn't restrict overflow
You can add this style to your top-level .container:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="container mt-4" style="overflow-x: hidden;">
‚úÖ 2. Fix .card-body overflow
Even though you wrapped the table with .table-responsive, your card‚Äôs inner container still may overflow. Add overflow-x: auto; to .card-body, and ensure it doesn't apply unnecessary padding.

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="card-body p-0" style="overflow-x: auto;">
You already did this here ‚Äî ‚úÖ good.

‚úÖ 3. Clamp the inner .table width (this is your missing piece)
Your table currently uses w-100, which forces the table to stretch wider than it needs. Remove w-100, and instead apply:

html
Copy
Edit
<table class="table table-sm table-striped mb-0">
The combination of .table-responsive (which scrolls when needed) and avoiding w-100 will prevent the table from pushing outside the card container.

üîç Bonus: Enforce word-wrap in tight cells
Some cells like Notes or long SKUs may still cause overflow. You can force wrap:

css
Copy
Edit
table td {
  word-break: break-word;
}
Or inline:

html
Copy
Edit
<td style="word-break: break-word;">
‚úÖ Summary of Fixes to Apply
Change 1 (remove w-100):
html
Copy
Edit
<table class="table table-sm table-striped mb-0">
Change 2 (ensure table wrapper remains):
html
Copy
Edit
<div class="table-responsive">
  ...
</div>
Change 3 (optional container cap):
html
Copy
Edit
<div class="container mt-4" style="overflow-x: hidden;">
