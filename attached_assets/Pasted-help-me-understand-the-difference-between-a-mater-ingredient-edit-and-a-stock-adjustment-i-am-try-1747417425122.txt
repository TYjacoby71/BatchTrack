help me understand the difference between a mater ingredient edit and a stock adjustment. 

i am trying to edit the update stock button on the inventory page before we make the ingredient view page. 

is that right?

this should be a general stock update button on the inventory page for purchases

i want it to say item, quantity change, and unit and reason. the reason would select if the quantity change is addition or subtraction. but, there are a couple that are vague. 

sugested reasons. 

restock (purchase)
spoil (waste)
trash(just didnt need it anymore... amybe redundant, but I wanta a difference to track expired ingredients vs just trash- should be a deduction)
recount(this is a vague one. could go up or down. perhaps this should be done on a master edit in the ingredient view page. just entery inventory quantity and reason for change. up or down doesnt matter when you say inventroy recount. it just is the new quantity and the tracking can store that event. ie inventory was 5 now 3. reason or even would be recount by X user. that would take the place of the batch use id right?

You are asking the exact right question — and your intuition is spot on.

Let’s walk through it step by step.

🧠 1. What's the Difference?
🔧 Master Ingredient Edit (a.k.a. "True State Override")
You are saying: “This is the new reality.”

You don’t care what came before. You’re not adding or subtracting — you’re resetting.

Example:
“We just counted the shelf. There aren’t 5 jars — there are 3.”

You want this reflected in the system, no questions asked.

➡️ Use case:
Recounts — a correction of your understanding of reality, not a transaction

📥📤 Stock Adjustment (a.k.a. Transaction)
This is an event that adds or removes inventory

It has a reason, a quantity delta, and maybe a cost

Example:
“We bought 50 jars.” → +50 with a purchase cost
“We tossed 12 that smelled weird.” → -12 due to spoilage
“We didn’t end up using this batch. Just threw it out.” → -8 with “trash” reason

➡️ Use case:
Transactions — an action happened, and we’re logging it

🧾 2. Suggested UI Flow (You're Right)
✅ On the Inventory Page:
Add a Stock Adjustment button per ingredient

Opens a modal with:

Ingredient Name (readonly)

Quantity change

Unit (dropdown or autofilled from ingredient)

Reason (dropdown)

Suggested Reasons (with their logic)
Reason	Type	Notes
Restock (Purchase)	Add	Should record cost per unit too
Spoil	Subtract	Expired, damaged
Trash	Subtract	Not bad — just no longer needed
Recount	Override (not +/-)	Should be handled on the View Ingredient page

🔁 3. Recount ≠ Adjustment — It’s a Reset
Recount is not “+5” or “-2”
It’s “I checked, and it’s now 3 — regardless of what you thought before.”

So yes:
✅ Recount should live on the Ingredient View Page
✅ It’s a master override:

New total quantity

Optional reason + user note

Logged in the InventoryHistory like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "change_type": "recount",
  "previous_quantity": 5,
  "new_quantity": 3,
  "user": "Kandace",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-15"
}
This does replace the need for a batch ID or transaction reason — it just is a declared truth.

📦 Summary:
Page	Purpose	Action
Inventory Page	Stock changes (purchase, spoil, trash)	Record changes via event logs
Ingredient View Page	Master recount	Override quantity and log that event

✅ Yes, You're Doing It Right
Before we build the Ingredient View Page, you are right to:

Update the “Update Stock” button on the Inventory Page

Make it log adjustments with reasons

Reserve recounts for a separate master override action
