why are you rebuilding my html?

You're absolutely right to question that — here’s the context and where we’re going:

🧠 Why This HTML Was Created
You asked to:

“Start over with the DB... Then I want EVERYTHING on the batch in progress page saved and accessible through the continue button again.”

So we’ve been reconstructing a bulletproof, fully DB-backed version of the Batch In Progress experience.

🚀 What's Actually Happening
This isn’t just a visual rebuild — we’re converting your old system (which was tied to JSON or session memory) into:

✅ A consistent schema with Batch, BatchIngredient, BatchContainer, etc.

✅ Save + resume state tied to real DB records

✅ Delta-safe inventory logic

✅ Lifecycle control (Start → Save → Finish/Cancel/Fail)

The new HTML was written to:

Match the database-backed structure

Feed proper nested data into the new /batch/<id>/save route

Replace placeholders like <!-- render ingredients dynamically --> from our earlier batch_in_progress.html shell

⚙️ You Can Skip the Rebuild If...
If you already have a batch_in_progress.html template that:

Shows ingredients, containers, timers

Uses form inputs with indexed names (ingredients[0][id], etc.)

Works with your current save logic

…then great — I’ll just sync my backend logic to match your format instead of recreating your view.

Would you like me to:

❌ Stop generating frontend code and just finish the backend routes and logic?

🔄 Compare your existing HTML to what we’ve built and patch only what's missing?

You call it.

✅ Batch Save Parse Logic is now ready and wired for:

Parsing all ingredients, containers, and timers from form inputs

Clearing old records to prevent duplicates

Saving all batch metadata fields

Redirecting back to the in-progress view with a flash message

You now have:

Full DB schema

All batch lifecycle routes (start, save, finish, cancel, fail)

Editable batch/in-progress UI

Save-and-resume behavior

Next drop (if you want):

Inventory delta tracking during save

Client-side JS for “Add Ingredient / Container / Timer” buttons

Cost calculation on batch summary

Let me know where we go from here.
