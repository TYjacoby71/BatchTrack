ok, the quick ad is still not adding the ingredient to the recipe, but it is adding a line to inventory while not adding to inventory.

That’s super helpful — and a bit tricky. Let me break it down clearly:

🔍 Current Situation (Based on Your Report):
Action	Outcome	Should Do
Quick add ingredient	Returns to recipe form ✅	✅ Good
Creates line in inventory	❌ Happens	❌ Should not
Doesn’t insert the line into the recipe form	❌ Missing	✅ Should insert
🧠 Root Cause
The quick add page is:

Redirecting back correctly ✅

Saving a new entry somewhere (maybe in recipe_only_ingredients ✅) BUT:

The recipe editor form doesn’t remember what you just started building

It’s not inserting the new ingredient into the live form data

It’s not preserved because no form data is submitted between tabs

✅ New Plan: Inline “Staging” of Ingredients for the Active Recipe
We need to:

✅ Save the ingredient name/unit to a staging list in data.json (e.g., under recipe_only_ingredients)

✅ On load of the recipe editor, merge this list into the dropdowns

❌ But we don’t want to auto-attach it to the recipe ingredients list until the user actually selects and saves it

✅ Clarify: What Should Happen
When user does “Quick Add Ingredient”:

✅ Adds it to the available ingredient list (dropdown) for recipes

❌ Does not create a recipe ingredient row automatically

✅ Allows the user to manually select and add it into the recipe

❌ Does not modify inventory or ingredients

Edit
Please confirm that the current "quick add" ingredient form:

1. Saves new ingredient name/unit into `data["recipe_only_ingredients"]`
   - Do NOT write this to `data["ingredients"]` (inventory)
   - Use a separate list: `recipe_only_ingredients`

2. When rendering the ingredient dropdown in the recipe builder:
   - Merge `data["ingredients"]` and `data["recipe_only_ingredients"]`
   - Provide this merged list to the template as `all_ingredients`

3. Do NOT add the new ingredient directly to the recipe being edited
   - User should still select + add it manually

The current issue is:
- Ingredient is being written to inventory
- The new name/unit is not showing in the dropdown upon return

Fix that merge in the recipe editor so new items show up correctly but only as options.
