You've asked the perfect question, and your intuition is spot on.
You're right, for a single class, this module is well-organized. It has clear methods, consistent naming, and a logical flow. If you were to hand this file to another developer, they could understand what it does.
However, the answer to "Should it be split?" is an emphatic yes.
What you have is a perfect example of a well-written but monolithic "UI Controller". It's a highly competent and organized solo worker who is doing the job of an entire team. The problem is that this one worker is responsible for everything:
State Management: It holds all the data (this.recipe, this.scale, this.containerPlan).
API Communication: It knows how to format and send fetch requests (fetchContainerPlan).
DOM Manipulation: It's directly building HTML strings and setting element styles (innerHTML, style.display).
Event Handling: It's listening for every click and input (bindEvents).
This creates several problems as an application grows.
The Litmus Test: Questions That Reveal the Cracks
Ask yourself these questions about your current code:
How would I test the API logic? How can you test fetchContainerPlan without having a real browser with a DOM and all the HTML elements present? You can't. The API logic is trapped.
What if I want to reuse the progress bar? What if another page needs that exact same updateContainmentProgress logic? You'd have to copy and paste it, because it's tied directly to this class.
Where is the "single source of truth" for the scale? Is it this.scale or is it document.getElementById('batchScale').value? The logic has to constantly keep them in sync, which is a common source of bugs.
What happens when the design changes? If a designer asks you to replace the Bootstrap cards with a different component, you have to go hunting through your application logic (displayContainerResults) to change HTML strings, which is risky and feels wrong.
The Solution: Separate the "Brains" from the "Body"
The problem is not a lack of organization; it's a mixing of concerns. The solution is to split the file based on its responsibilities.
Here are the clear "zones" in your current class that are begging to be their own modules:
Zone 1: DOM Manipulation (The "UI Renderer")
These methods only exist to read from or write to the screen. They shouldn't contain any business logic.
updateProjectedYield
displayContainerResults
displayContainerError
updateContainmentProgress
toggleManualContainerSection
All the document.getElementById calls.
This could become a ui.js module. It would export functions like renderContainerCards(containers) and updateProgressBar(percentage).
Zone 2: API Logic (The "API Service")
This method's only job is to communicate with the server. It doesn't know what a "progress bar" is.
fetchContainerPlan
getCSRFToken
This should become an api.js module. It would export a function like getContainerPlan({ recipeId, yieldAmount, yieldUnit }) that just returns the JSON data or throws an error.
Zone 3: State Management (The "State")
These are the core data points your application cares about.
recipe, scale, batchType, requiresContainers, containerPlan
This could become a simple state.js object or be managed by the main controller.
Zone 4: Orchestration (The "Controller" or "Main App")
This is the "brains." It connects the other pieces.
init
bindEvents
The logic inside the event listeners (e.g., "when the scale changes, update the state, then tell the API to fetch, then tell the UI to render the result").
This would be your new, much smaller PlanProductionApp.js or main.js.
The Verdict
Your module is like a well-organized toolbox where all the tools are permanently welded together. It's neat, but you can't pick up just the screwdriver when you need it.
Splitting it is the next step in professional development. It will feel like more files and more code initially, but you will gain:
Testability: You can now test your API calls and UI components independently.
Reusability: You can import the API service or UI components anywhere.
Maintainability: When the API contract changes, you only touch api.js. When the design changes, you only touch ui.js.
Action Plan: Start by creating an api.js file. Move fetchContainerPlan and getCSRFToken into it. Export fetchContainerPlan and import it back into your PlanProductionApp. You will immediately feel how much cleaner it is. Then, do the same for the UI methods.
