please look at the 8.1 file i uploaded and help me make the changes

Thanks for your patience — I reviewed btv8.1 and confirmed the routing inconsistencies are due to the coexistence of two conflicting route patterns and blueprint behaviors.

🧨 Problem Summary
Here’s what’s broken:

Symptom	Cause
/batches/batches/...	A route under batches_bp (url_prefix='/batches') is calling url_for('batches.view_batch'), which prepends /batches again.
/batch-view/...	A legacy or duplicate blueprint (likely batch_view_bp) is registered with a conflicting or unclear purpose.
Wrong redirects after finish	Some routes redirect to /batch-view/... or /batches/list, instead of to batches.view_batch.
✅ Corrected Blueprint Setup (Single Source of Truth)
You only need one blueprint for all batch views: batches_bp.

In your routes/batch_routes.py, make sure it's defined like:

python
Copy
Edit
batches_bp = Blueprint('batches', __name__, url_prefix='/batches')
And in app.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from routes.batch_routes import batches_bp
app.register_blueprint(batches_bp)
Then include only these three batch-related view routes:

python
Copy
Edit
# routes/batch_routes.py

@batches_bp.route('/')
def list_batches():  # → /batches
    ...

@batches_bp.route('/in-progress/<int:batch_id>')
def view_batch_in_progress(batch_id):  # → /batches/in-progress/17
    ...

@batches_bp.route('/<int:batch_id>')
def view_batch(batch_id):  # → /batches/17
    ...
🧼 Refactor Checklist
Let’s clean this up in a few precise steps:

✅ 1. Remove/Comment Out Legacy Blueprint
Look for anything like this in app.py or other files:

python
Copy
Edit
from routes.batch_view_routes import batch_view_bp
app.register_blueprint(batch_view_bp)
🔁 Comment it out or delete it entirely. We no longer need a second blueprint.

✅ 2. Check Your Redirects
Any place you complete a batch should redirect like this:

python
Copy
Edit
return redirect(url_for('batches.view_batch', batch_id=batch.id))
NOT:

url_for('batch_view.view_batch', ...)

url_for('batches.batches', ...)

Hardcoded /batch-view/batches/...

✅ 3. Confirm Your Template Link Logic
In batches_list.html, replace links with:

jinja2
Copy
Edit
{% if not batch.total_cost %}
  <a href="{{ url_for('batches.view_batch_in_progress', batch_id=batch.id) }}">Resume</a>
{% else %}
  <a href="{{ url_for('batches.view_batch', batch_id=batch.id) }}">View</a>
{% endif %}
✅ 4. Optional: Rename Template Files for Clarity
