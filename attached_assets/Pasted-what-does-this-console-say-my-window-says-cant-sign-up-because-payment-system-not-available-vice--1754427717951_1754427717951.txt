The console log you posted says that Stripe pricing is loading successfully, and there's no actual error or failure in the backend.

Here‚Äôs what it shows:

‚úÖ Stripe Pricing Load Summary:
Tier	Status
solo	‚úÖ Found price $8
team	‚úÖ Found price $15
enterprise	‚úÖ Found price $20

plaintext
Copy
Edit
INFO in billing_service: Successfully retrieved pricing for 3 tiers from Stripe
INFO in billing_service: Final pricing data assembled for 3 tiers
No exceptions, timeouts, or Stripe-related issues are logged.

‚ùå Problem: "Can't sign up because payment system not available"
This message is likely coming from your frontend or signup controller logic, even though Stripe is working.

üîç Likely Causes Based on Your Logs
1. ‚úÖ Stripe Pricing Loaded Fine
You have pricing available ‚Äî the signup page has access to it.

2. ‚ùå But this log line shows the POST /auth/signup returned a 200
plaintext
Copy
Edit
"POST /auth/signup?source=homepage_trial HTTP/1.1" 200 32135
A 200 OK on POST suggests the form submitted, but the server may have:

Rendered the same page again with an error message

Shown a flash error like: ‚ÄúPayment system not available‚Äù

üõ†Ô∏è Your Likely Signup Flow Logic:
You probably have something like this in your Flask route:

python
Copy
Edit
if not stripe_pricing_data:
    flash("Payment system not available")
    return render_template("signup.html")
So even if Stripe is working, maybe:

You failed to pass stripe_pricing_data into the signup template

Or, the pricing is loading async and not yet rendered when needed

Or, you're checking for a tier that doesn‚Äôt exist in config even though pricing exists

‚úÖ Steps to Debug and Fix
‚úÖ 1. Confirm Flask Signup Route
In /auth/signup, look for logic like:

python
Copy
Edit
pricing = BillingService.get_pricing_with_snapshots()

if not pricing:
    flash("Payment system not available", "error")
    return render_template("signup.html")
üõ† Add a debug print there:

python
Copy
Edit
print("DEBUG: Signup pricing keys:", pricing.keys())
If it‚Äôs returning fine, the problem is likely in template rendering or logic after pricing is retrieved.

‚úÖ 2. Check Template for Fallbacks
In signup.html, make sure you handle pricing like:

jinja2
Copy
Edit
{% if pricing %}
  <form>... pricing options ...</form>
{% else %}
  <div class="error">Payment system not available</div>
{% endif %}
If the logic above mistakenly evaluates an empty dictionary or misnames the variable, it could show the wrong message.

‚úÖ 3. Log Stripe Health on Load
Add a log line on /auth/signup:

python
Copy
Edit
print("DEBUG: Stripe healthy?", BillingService._is_stripe_healthy())
This will confirm if your server thinks Stripe is down, even if pricing loaded.

üîö TL;DR
‚úÖ Stripe is working and pricing loaded correctly.

‚ùå Frontend or route logic is probably misdetecting availability and showing an error.

üõ† Check: pricing dictionary is passed, accessed, and rendered correctly in signup template.

Would you like me to review your /auth/signup route logic for the condition that triggers this message? You can paste just the route block.
