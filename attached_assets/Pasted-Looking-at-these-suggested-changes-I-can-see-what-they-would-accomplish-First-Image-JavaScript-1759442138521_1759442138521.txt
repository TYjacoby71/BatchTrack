Looking at these suggested changes, I can see what they would accomplish:

First Image (JavaScript changes):
This adds developer-only functionality to the Global Library page:

Line 189: Adds a comment indicating this is for showing the Developer Details link once we know the item ID
Lines 269-282: Adds JavaScript code that:
Checks if the current user is a developer (is_developer())
If they are a developer, it creates a link to /developer/global-items/{id}
Shows this link, otherwise hides it
This gives developers direct access to the detailed item management page
Second Image (HTML Template changes):
This modifies the Global Library template to add developer-only UI elements:

Lines 5-15: Adds a developer-only section with:
A "Manage Categories" button linking to ingredient categories
An "Add Global Item" button for creating new items
Line 64: Adds a developer-only table column header
Lines 84-88: Adds a developer-only "Edit" button in each table row that links to the detailed item management page
Third & Fourth Images (Backend Route changes):
These show extensive changes to the developer routes file, adding:

Container Management: New routes and functionality for managing container master lists (materials, types, styles, colors)
Global Item Management: Enhanced CRUD operations for global items
Category Management: Functions for managing ingredient categories
API Endpoints: New API routes for various developer operations
What These Changes Accomplish:
Separates User vs Developer Views: Regular users see a read-only global library, while developers get full management capabilities
Adds Developer Tools: Developers can create, edit, and manage global items directly from the library interface
Improves Workflow: Instead of having separate pages, developers get contextual management tools right in the library view
Maintains Clean UX: Non-developers see a clean, simple interface while developers get the tools they need
These changes essentially transform the Global Library from a simple reference page into a dual-purpose tool that serves both end users (read-only reference) and developers (full management interface) based on their permissions.
