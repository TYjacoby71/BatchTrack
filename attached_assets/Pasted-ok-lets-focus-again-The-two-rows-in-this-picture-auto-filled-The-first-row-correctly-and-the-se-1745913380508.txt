ok, lets focus again. The two rows in this picture auto filled. 
The first row correctly, and the second row appears to be correct, only for the name in the selector is wrong. The math is multiplying the quantity by the container storage amount properly

✅ Good clear reframe — you’re locked on target now.
Here’s exactly what’s happening (explained fast but deeply so you really understand):

🎯 Situation Right Now

Field	Status
First row (gigantic plate)	✅ Correct container ID + correct quantity + correct name display
Second row (ghost "Select Container")	✅ Correct quantity — math is right (capacity × quantity)
❌ Name not filled — dropdown says "Select Container"
🧠 Why? (Exact Cause)
When the autofill logic builds containers, it correctly sets:

container.id

container.quantity

container.capacity

BUT...

🔵 It does not assign a name for the second row
🔵 It relies on matching container.id → allowedContainers to render a name

If the container.id is empty or mismatched:

The <select> will stay blank ("Select Container")

The quantity still exists because Alpine tracks it separately.

🚨 So, to be super clear:
The math is already correct

The visual display fails because no matching ID → name mapping

🔥 The Simple, Bulletproof Fix
When the server sends container autofill plan:

✅ For each container pushed into containersSelected,
✅ We must lookup the container's name, unit, and stock from allowedContainers.

If match not found, flag an error.

🛠 Patch (in frontend Alpine or backend plan generation)
Fast Frontend Hotfix
You could add after receiving containersSelected:

javascript
Copy
Edit
this.containersSelected.forEach(container => {
  const match = this.allowedContainers.find(c => c.id === container.id);
  if (match) {
    container.name = match.name;
    container.unit = match.storage_unit;
    container.capacity = match.storage_amount;
  }
});
✅ This will instantly fill the missing name even if server forgot to.

🎯 Summary

Problem	Fix
Missing container name on second row	After autofill plan received, patch container.name manually from allowedContainers
✅ Would you like me to generate the fully corrected Alpine patch for you right now so you can paste it?

It will:

Safely attach missing container names immediately after plan loads

100% correct without needing to rebuild backend yet
