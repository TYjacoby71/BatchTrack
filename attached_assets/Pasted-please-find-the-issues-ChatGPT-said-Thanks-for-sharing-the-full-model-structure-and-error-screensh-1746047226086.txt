Thanks for sharing the full model structure and error screenshot. Let’s walk through the problems and fix the root causes. You're getting:

SQL error when running a query related to started_at column
🔍 Summary of Issues
❌ 1. Missing constraint name in migration
This is what causes:

ValueError: Constraint must have a name

In Alembic, when adding a ForeignKeyConstraint, it must be explicitly named if you're using op.create_foreign_key(...). Example:

python
Copy
Edit
op.create_foreign_key(
    "fk_batch_recipe",  # ✅ Must name the constraint
    "batch",            # Source table
    "recipe",           # Referenced table
    ["recipe_id"],      # Local column
    ["id"],             # Remote column
)
❌ 2. Multiple migrations trying to add started_at
The log shows:

“started_at column multiple times across different migrations”

This happens when:

You added started_at in one migration

Then it was either manually added again, or not marked as applied

Alembic tries to re-apply it, causing conflict

✅ Fix Strategy
Step 1: 🔧 Patch batch_data_storage_update.py
Add constraint names like this:

python
Copy
Edit
op.create_foreign_key(
    'fk_batch_recipe', 'batch', 'recipe', ['recipe_id'], ['id']
)
op.create_foreign_key(
    'fk_batch_product', 'batch', 'product', ['product_id'], ['id']
)
op.create_foreign_key(
    'fk_batch_variant', 'batch', 'product_variation', ['variant_id'], ['id']
)
Do this for every unnamed create_foreign_key call in your migration.

Step 2: 🔥 Remove duplicate started_at additions
Search your migrations folder for any of these:

bash
Copy
Edit
grep "started_at" migrations/versions/*.py
If multiple migrations try to add the same column (e.g., started_at to batch), remove all but the earliest one, or merge them.

Step 3: ✅ Reset and re-run migration
If you're early enough and safe to wipe data:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -f instance/batchtrack.db
flask db downgrade base
flask db upgrade
If not safe to wipe, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
flask db merge -m "Fix started_at conflict"
📌 Final Validation Checklist
 All ForeignKey constraints in migration files have a name

 Only one migration adds the started_at column

 No duplication of batch_id, recipe_id, etc. in multiple files

 Alembic heads are merged if needed
