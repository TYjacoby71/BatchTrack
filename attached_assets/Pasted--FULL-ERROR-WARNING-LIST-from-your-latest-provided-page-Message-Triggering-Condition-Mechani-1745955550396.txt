🛡️ FULL ERROR/WARNING LIST (from your latest provided page)

#	Message	Triggering Condition	Mechanism	Location
1	Please uncheck Auto-Fill to add containers manually.	User clicks "Add Container" while autoFill === true	alert()	JavaScript
2	Warning: Some containers will be partially filled.	After loading container plan, if containmentPercent < 100	In containmentIssue, shows Bootstrap alert-warning div	Page
3	You need X more containers to make this batch.	If total available container stock is insufficient vs projected yield	Appended to containmentIssue	Page
4	No containers selected. Please add containers or enable Auto-Fill.	If containersSelected.length === 0	Bootstrap alert-danger div	Page
5	You do not have enough containers selected, or there will be X units left over. Would you like to continue anyway?	When user clicks "Check Stock", but containment < 100% and not flex mode	confirm()	JavaScript
6	✅ All ingredients are available!	After stock check, if stockCheckPassed === true	Bootstrap alert-success div	Page
7	⚠ Some ingredients are low or missing. Adjust inventory before proceeding.	After stock check, if stockCheckPassed === false	Bootstrap alert-warning div	Page
8	No items need restocking!	When user tries to download shopping list but no LOW or NEEDED items	alert()	JavaScript
9	Batch would be started. Backend logic needed.	Placeholder when clicking "Start Batch"	alert()	JavaScript
10	(Console only) API errors from fetch failures like check stock / container plans.	catch(err => console.error(err))	console.error()	Browser Console
🧠 Important Observations:
All user-facing alerts are accounted for.

FlexMode (flexMode = true) is toggled only via user consent through the stock check warning dialog — ✅ Good.

Container row validation is now silent.

The system automatically sets quantity to 0 or clamps to stock without throwing an alert or error.

✅ (This is better UX — no "hard stop" alerting, just correct silently.)

The "Available" container quantities are updated live per row, so now unavailable containers don't show or are disabled.

No hydration/race problems observed in this AlpineJS version based on what you posted.

🔥 Do You Want This Too?
Would you like me to also produce a clean checklist you can use for manual QA testing like:

✅ "AutoFill blocks manual adds"
✅ "Container stock error handled quietly"
✅ "Stock check shows correct results"
✅ "Batch cannot start unless all conditions are correct"

It would help you catch regressions in the future.

Should I make that for you too? 🚀
(Only takes a few minutes to format it tightly.)

i want to work over the error messges. 

1. the boxes are just greyd out. I want a click in the container, quantity, or delete row to yiled the message. The click detection apears to not be in place. The message you have is good.

2 and 3 are showing together. 

2 should show if the yield is unable to fully fill the last container. example, only 1 container of 5 count and 1 container of 1 count. container total 6 count but batch yield is 5.5. and add a 5% filter. for example, I can selected scale of 1.5 that yields 7.5 count and selected 8 1 count containers. it shows 100% containment, but no partial fill message. 

3 should only show when the total containers available cannot contain the batch. so total stock < scale units needed
4. is ok
5. ok
6. good so far
7. good.
8. lets hid the export function buttons display when check is good.. the warning is good
9. 
4.

Got it — you're thinking very clearly here.
Let’s break down what you’re asking carefully.

🛠️ Here’s a Work Plan Based on Your Instructions:
1. Container Selection & Quantity Inputs: Click Protection and Error
✅ Current: If no stock, quantity becomes 0 and disabled – but no feedback if user tries.

✅ What you want:

If a user clicks into a disabled container row (select, quantity, or delete button),

Show an alert or visible warning:
👉 "This container is no longer available. Please select a different one."

✅ What needs patching:

Add @click listeners on the dropdown, input, and delete button.

Trigger an alert or inline error message.

(I'll suggest inline for better UX.)

2. Separation of Error 2 and Error 3: Different Containment Situations
✅ Current:
Both partial fill and total stock insufficient are merged into 1 message (containmentIssue).

✅ You want:
Separate clearly:


#	Case	When to trigger?	Message
2	Partial container fill warning	Containment is technically 100%, but leftover < 5% of 1 container	"Warning: Some containers will be partially filled."
3	Total stock insufficient error	Available stock cannot possibly meet batch scale	"Error: You need X more containers to fully contain the batch."
✅ What needs patching:

Calculate residual uncontained units (remainingToContain) after "full" fill.

If small residual (< 5% of container size), it’s a partial fill warning, not a containment error.

If true stock available is < batch yield, it's a hard error.

3. Check Stock Export Buttons Logic
✅ Current:
CSV and Shopping List buttons always show after stock check.

✅ You want:

Only show Download CSV and Shopping List if stock check fails (ingredients missing or low).

Hide if stock is perfect.

✅ What needs patching:

Wrap the buttons under a condition like:

html
Copy
Edit
<template x-if="!stockCheckPassed">
  <div> ... buttons ... </div>
</template>
✍️ In short, you want:

Task	Status	Plan
Click on unavailable container triggers alert	🔵 Needs patch	Add @click to inputs/buttons
Separate partial fill warning and total stock error	🔵 Needs patch	Differentiate based on 5% threshold and total available
Hide CSV / Shopping List buttons when stock OK	🔵 Needs patch	Simple Alpine x-if="!stockCheckPassed"
Minor UX cleanups for warnings layout	🔵 Optional	Tweak Bootstrap classes
✅ Confirmed Messages After Patch

Message	Trigger
"This container is no longer available."	Click into disabled select/input/delete
"Warning: Some containers will be partially filled."	Small fractional leftover, <5%
"Error: You need X more containers to fully contain the batch."	Total stock insufficient
"No containers selected."	No container rows
"Would you like to continue anyway?"	Insufficient containment + manual confirm
"✅ All ingredients are available!"	After good stock check
"⚠ Some ingredients are low or missing."	After failed stock check
"No items need restocking!"	No needed or low items for shopping list
