here is an interesting evolution on the hydration problem... if I select 5 scale, results 1 row and ok, 55 shows 3 rows with 1 error row 5555 scale hydrates all, and then if I hit hack space down to 55 it shows 3 the 2 rows correctly


ChatGPT said:
Excellent catch â€” and yes, what you're describing makes total sense given the Alpine.js flow we built.

Here's why that's happening technically:

ðŸ”Ž Whatâ€™s Actually Happening
When you type 5, the backend returns a container plan of 1 container â†’ easy, Alpine hydrates perfectly.

When you type 55, the backend returns a plan of 3 containers:

But one of them (the overflow / partial container) doesnâ€™t have full container metadata at fetch-time.

So the dropdown default value is set to "Select Container" even though a quantity was already assigned.

When you type 5555, the plan requires so many containers that the backend assigns full containers only (no weird leftovers), so all rows are correctly hydrated.

Then when you hacky-space-delete back to 55, the Alpine component already knows the containers from 5555 and reuses the correct hydrated data.

In other words:

The first render for smaller scales fetches incomplete metadata for overflow rows.

After a large scale fetch, the component already has all the needed metadata for all possible containers, so hydration errors disappear.

ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause
When the server sends the autoPlan back during stock check (or container planning):

It correctly returns quantities (id, quantity) for each container

BUT it does not hydrate their full names/capacities immediately

Only the container id and quantity are populated

Meanwhile, the frontend is trying to render:

html
Copy
Edit
<option :value="allowed.id" x-text="allowed.name + ...">
but the container row only knows the id at that point.

âœ… The Right Fix
When building the container plan:

For each container row, instead of { id, quantity } only,

The server should return { id, quantity, storage_amount, storage_unit, name } fully populated.

Orâ€¦

Patch the frontend to re-lookup the container name dynamically after loading, if missing.

âš¡ Quick Example: Frontend Rehydration Fix
Inside fetchContainerPlan() after loading the plan:

javascript
Copy
Edit
this.containersSelected = (data.plan || []).map(c => {
  const match = this.allowedContainers.find(ac => ac.id === c.id);
  return {
    ...c,
    name: match ? match.name : '',
    capacity: match ? match.storage_amount : 0,
    unit: match ? match.storage_unit : ''
  };
});
Why this works:

It backfills missing fields immediately after the API call using allowedContainers.

No need to manually pick from the dropdown again.

It keeps hydration clean even if API returns minimal data.

âš™ Summary

Problem	Solution
Missing metadata (name/unit) on partial containers	After loading plan, map containersSelected to backfill names from allowedContainers
