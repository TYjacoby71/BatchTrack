Thanks for your patience. Here's a full diagnosis of the errors and fixes based on your most recent file upload:

‚úÖ Key Problems Found in Your Console & Code
1. Alpine x-for Key Error
Console says:

x-for="allowed in recipe.allowed_containers" ‚Üí key is undefined or invalid

‚úÖ Problem: You are using recipe.allowed_containers in the dropdown template, but in your Alpine data() object, the allowedContainers are fetched dynamically and populated via fetchContainerPlan().

‚ùå recipe.allowed_containers may not be defined at runtime in the Alpine scope. ‚úÖ You're also using .allowed.id instead of just .id inside the template.

2. Duplicate & Invalid x-for Keys
html
Copy
Edit
<template x-for="allowed in recipe.allowed_containers" :key="allowed.id">
‚úÖ Fix: Change this to pull from allowedContainers only, which is correctly bound inside Alpine:

html
Copy
Edit
<template x-for="allowed in allowedContainers" :key="allowed.id">
3. JS Error in Check Stock
Console says:

Error checking stock: SyntaxError {}

‚úÖ Problem: This usually means the response from /api/check-stock isn't JSON (often an HTML error or traceback).

Likely culprit: The backend route /api/check-stock is not parsing your JSON or the frontend sent malformed JSON.

‚úÖ Fix Suggestion: Make sure this backend route contains:

python
Copy
Edit
data = request.get_json(force=True)
And that your fetch call has the correct structure.

‚úÖ Recommended Patches
‚úÖ Patch 1: Fix the x-for binding in HTML
Replace:

html
Copy
Edit
<template x-for="allowed in recipe.allowed_containers" :key="allowed.id">
With:

html
Copy
Edit
<template x-for="allowed in allowedContainers" :key="allowed.id">
‚úÖ Patch 2: Fix API call or route handler for stock check
If your current route is:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.route('/api/check-stock', methods=['POST'])
def check_stock():
    data = request.get_json()  # üîÅ possibly None
    ...
Change it to:

python
Copy
Edit
data = request.get_json(force=True)
Also make sure the frontend fetch includes Content-Type: application/json.

‚úÖ Bonus: Alpine UI Quality Suggestions
While reviewing your plan_production.html, everything else looks solid:

Reactive UI

Containment math logic

Error handling

Manual/auto-fill logic split
