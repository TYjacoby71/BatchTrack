Multi model system for products is turning into a nightmare. How do I do all this in one model with multiple tables do I just need to have product table variant table etc?


ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right to ask this ‚Äî the complexity from multi-model sprawl (Product, Variant, SKU, Service, API-layer mapping, etc.) can become overbearing fast, especially when you're doing most of the dev yourself.

Here's how to simplify this while still following clean database practices:

‚úÖ GOAL: One ‚ÄúProduct System‚Äù ‚Äî Multiple Tables, One Logical Model
The goal is not to merge everything into one table, but to have one clear source of truth (SKU) while using clean foreign key relationships across a simple, modular structure:

‚úÖ Recommended Clean Product Model System
1. Product Table (parent product line)
id

name

base_unit

category, subcategory

created_by, created_at, is_active, etc.

shopify_product_id, tags, etc.

‚úÖ Holds what the product is conceptually.
e.g. "Royal Tallow"

2. ProductVariant Table (variation like scent or type)
id

product_id ‚Üí FK to Product

name (e.g., Lavender)

material, color, size (optional attributes)

is_active, created_at

‚úÖ Tracks scent, type, finish ‚Äî anything pre-size.

3. ProductSKU Table (the sellable unit)
id

product_id, variant_id ‚Üí FKs

size_label (e.g., 2 oz jar)

sku_code, barcode, upc

unit, retail_price, cost, reserved_qty, fifo_id, etc.

container_id, batch_id, etc.

‚úÖ This is the real thing being sold or shipped.
e.g. "Royal Tallow ‚Äì Lavender ‚Äì 2oz Jar"

4. ProductSKUHistory (optional, FIFO/performance)
Tracks changes to ProductSKU

Deducts/adds inventory with FIFO, spoilage, sales, etc.

‚úÖ FIFO audit trail.

‚òëÔ∏è Your Final Model View Looks Like:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Product        ‚Üí    ProductVariant    ‚Üí    ProductSKU       ‚Üí     ProductSKUHistory
(name, base)        (scent/type)          (size/container)         (inventory log)
üß† How This Simplifies:
You query ProductSKU as the endpoint: sales, batch outputs, Shopify hooks.

You only go up to Product or Variant for display, tags, or filtering.

All inventory, cost, and stock logic lives in ProductSKU.

You never need more than 3 joins (Product ‚Üí Variant ‚Üí SKU).

üí° If You Want One Python File to Rule Them All
You can put all of these SQLAlchemy models in models/product.py as long as they‚Äôre logically grouped and scoped with comments like:

python
Copy
Edit
# ---------------- Product Model ----------------
class Product(db.Model):
    ...

# -------------- ProductVariant ----------------
class ProductVariant(db.Model):
    ...

# ---------------- ProductSKU ------------------
class ProductSKU(db.Model):
    ...
That‚Äôs totally fine for a maker-size project. Just avoid repeating logic in multiple files like product_service.py, product_api.py, product_variant.py, etc., unless you truly need those abstractions.

‚úÖ Final Advice
Let SKU be your only inventory object.

Keep your Product and Variant tables light and relational.

Avoid splitting business logic unless it‚Äôs too large for one file.
