I am having a huge problem witht he unit conversion in the check stock button on the plan production page. I understand that the containers do call the check function to update their own logic live and they work good. 

I need to have the check stock button convert units properly. Currently, they are not converting before the check.

Thanks for the context and the uploaded project archive (btv-89472.zip). Based on your description, the problem lies in the unit conversion logic not executing when using the "Check Stock" button on the Plan Production page, even though container-level logic correctly updates live.

Here's my plan to help:
Extract and analyze the relevant codebase, focusing on:

The Check Stock button handler

Any unit conversion logic tied to the containers

Shared services/utilities for unit conversion

Identify whether the Check Stock logic is bypassing conversion, and if so, where the fix should go.

Let's start by extracting and analyzing the source code from your zip.

The project has a solid structure. Based on your issue, the most relevant files are:

unit_conversion_utils.py: likely contains the core unit conversion logic.

stock_check_utils.py: possibly involved in the "Check Stock" operation.

routes/: likely holds Flask endpoints, possibly including the "Check Stock" handler.

templates/: may have the front-end for the Plan Production page.

Next Step:
I’ll inspect:

unit_conversion_utils.py — to see how conversion is handled.

stock_check_utils.py — to see if it's used in the "Check Stock" flow and whether it calls the conversion logic.

Let’s start with unit_conversion_utils.py. ​​

The UnitConversionService class provides the conversion logic:

It uses a convert_units(amount, from_unit, to_unit, ...) static method.

Checks for:

Custom unit mappings

Equal units

Matching unit types with multiplier conversions

This logic appears solid.

Next Step:
Let’s now check stock_check_utils.py to see if it uses this service during the "Check Stock" operation—or if this is the missing link. ​​

This is very insightful. In check_stock_for_recipe() inside stock_check_utils.py, I see the relevant logic:

python
Copy
Edit
needed = assoc.amount * scale
needed_converted = ConversionEngine.convert_units(needed, assoc.unit, ing.unit)
So unit conversion is in place—via ConversionEngine.convert_units.

However, two potential problems could still exist:

Wrong units passed in: If assoc.unit or ing.unit are not the correct strings (e.g. "g", "kg", etc.), the conversion could silently fail or be skipped (as seen with the except block).

Check Stock button might be using a route or function that bypasses this logic entirely.

Next Step: Confirm the route connected to "Check Stock" on the Plan Production page.
Let’s inspect the routes/ directory to find the endpoint and check whether it uses check_stock_for_recipe() from stock_check_utils.py. ​​

The file stock_check_api.py looks like the most likely candidate for handling the "Check Stock" button behavior.

Let's dig into that to verify whether it:

Calls check_stock_for_recipe(), and

Passes appropriate units and ingredient IDs.

That will help confirm whether conversion is missing, incorrect, or simply bypassed. ​​

Here’s the problem:

The /api/check-stock route in stock_check_api.py does not use the check_stock_for_recipe() function (from stock_check_utils.py), nor does it invoke the ConversionEngine.

Instead, it directly does:

python
Copy
Edit
required_qty = ri.amount * scale
stock_qty = ri.inventory_item.quantity
status = "OK" if stock_qty >= required_qty else "LOW"
This logic bypasses unit conversion completely.

✅ Solution:
Update the api_check_stock() function in stock_check_api.py to use:

python
Copy
Edit
from stock_check_utils import check_stock_for_recipe
and then replace the for-loop with a call like:

python
Copy
Edit
results, all_ok = check_stock_for_recipe(recipe, scale=scale)
Then format the results into a JSON response.
