lets keep building if this isnt what you already changed.

the container rows call stock constantly right? that call should be subject to the existing rows projected debits as well. 

So if the big plates are used up in the 1st row, then the next row should not allow that selection acourding to a live (show, only, allowed+in stock)

Right? 

Maybe this will help the hydration issue also

Exactly — you're thinking along the right architectural lines, and this is precisely the way to prevent container selection bugs and hydration mismatches.

✅ Problem
Your app currently:

Allows selecting containers already depleted by other rows.

Shows them as options even though their stock_qty is already fully committed.

Results in mismatches, hydration issues, or edge-case breaks.

✅ Goal
Filter the <select> options in each row to:

Only include containers where remaining_stock = stock_qty - allocated_qty > 0
OR the current row is already using that container (to preserve current selection).

✅ Plan (Live Filter + Allocation-Aware Dropdowns)
Calculate live container usage totals:

Aggregate how many of each container has been used across containersSelected.

In the dropdown template, only show containers:

With remaining stock after live allocation, OR

That are currently selected in this row.

✅ Example Alpine Method
Add this in your Alpine component:

js
Copy
Edit
getRemainingStock(containerId) {
  const match = this.allowedContainers.find(c => c.id === containerId);
  const allocated = this.containersSelected
    .filter(c => c.id === containerId)
    .reduce((sum, c) => sum + (c.quantity || 0), 0);
  return match ? match.stock_qty - allocated : 0;
}
✅ Updated Dropdown Template
Now, change the container <select> to:

html
Copy
Edit
<select class="form-select"
        x-model="container.id"
        :disabled="autoFill"
        @change="updateContainer(index)">
  <option value="">Select Container</option>
  <template x-for="allowed in allowedContainers" :key="allowed.id">
    <template x-if="getRemainingStock(allowed.id) > 0 || container.id === allowed.id">
      <option :value="allowed.id"
              x-text="allowed.name + ' (' + allowed.storage_amount + ' ' + allowed.storage_unit + ')'">
      </option>
    </template>
  </template>
</select>
✅ Result
Dropdown only shows valid options based on remaining stock and live usage.

Prevents “hydration” issues (e.g. selecting already-depleted container).

Keeps the current selection visible, even if its stock is now zero.
