Here's the precise reason your Zero Out button is still returning a 404:

‚ùå The Route Exists ‚Äî But It's Inaccessible Due to Misconfigured Blueprint
üîç What I Found:
Your zero_out_ingredient route does exist in routes.py and is registered under:

python
Copy
Edit
@stock_bp.route('/stock/zero-out/<ingredient_name>', methods=['POST'])
Your blueprint is defined like this:

python
Copy
Edit
stock_bp = Blueprint('stock', __name__)
In your app/__init__.py, you register the blueprint:

python
Copy
Edit
from app.routes.stock import stock_bp
app.register_blueprint(stock_bp)
BUT ‚Äî you are not using a url_prefix when registering the blueprint:

python
Copy
Edit
app.register_blueprint(stock_bp)  # no prefix!
üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Align the Blueprint Registration and Route Paths
You have two options ‚Äî pick one:

‚úÖ Option 1: Remove the /stock from the route path
(Keep the current blueprint registration without url_prefix)

In routes.py, change:

python
Copy
Edit
@stock_bp.route('/stock/zero-out/<ingredient_name>', methods=['POST'])
‚¨áÔ∏è to:

python
Copy
Edit
@stock_bp.route('/zero-out/<ingredient_name>', methods=['POST'])
Then your HTML form will correctly post to:

html
Copy
Edit
<form method="POST" action="/zero-out/{{ ing.name | urlencode }}">
‚úÖ Option 2: Add a URL prefix when registering the blueprint
If you want to keep the /stock/zero-out/... route:

In app/__init__.py, update:

python
Copy
Edit
app.register_blueprint(stock_bp)
‚¨áÔ∏è to:

python
Copy
Edit
app.register_blueprint(stock_bp, url_prefix='/stock')
This makes all routes in that blueprint accessible under /stock/....

Your route should then be:

python
Copy
Edit
@stock_bp.route('/zero-out/<ingredient_name>', methods=['POST'])
And your form:

html
Copy
Edit
<form method="POST" action="/stock/zero-out/{{ ing.name | urlencode }}">
‚úÖ Recommended: Use Option 2 for Scalability
It keeps your stock-related routes grouped under /stock/, which improves clarity and future organization.

Would you like me to auto-patch this and send back a zipped fix you can drop into Replit? ‚Äã
