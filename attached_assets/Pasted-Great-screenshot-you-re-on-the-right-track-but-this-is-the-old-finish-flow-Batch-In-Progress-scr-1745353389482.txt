Great screenshot — you're on the right track, but this is the old finish flow (Batch In Progress screen), and it's not quite what we need for the new product-linked finish flow.

🔍 What You’re Seeing Now:
✅ Batch label, recipe, and scale – good

✅ Ingredients used – displayed as expected

⚠️ Output Type dropdown – not yet functional

❌ No product selection, variant, or quantity tied to a real Product

✅ What We Need for the New Product-Aware Finish Flow:
Here’s what needs to be added after the summary, before notes:

✅ Final Output Section
jinja
Copy
Edit
<h4>Output Product</h4>

<div class="mb-3">
  <label for="product_id" class="form-label">Select Product</label>
  <select name="product_id" class="form-select" required>
    {% for product in products %}
      <option value="{{ product.id }}">{{ product.name }}</option>
    {% endfor %}
  </select>
  <a href="/products/new" class="btn btn-link">+ Add New Product</a>
</div>

<div class="mb-3">
  <label for="variant_label" class="form-label">Variant (optional)</label>
  <input type="text" class="form-control" name="variant_label" placeholder="e.g., 4 oz, Citrus">
</div>

<div class="mb-3">
  <label for="output_unit" class="form-label">Output Unit</label>
  <select name="output_unit" class="form-select" required>
    {% for unit in units if unit.type == 'count' %}
      <option value="{{ unit.name }}">{{ unit.name }}</option>
    {% endfor %}
  </select>
</div>

<div class="mb-3">
  <label for="final_quantity" class="form-label">Final Quantity Produced</label>
  <input type="number" name="final_quantity" step="1" class="form-control" required>
</div>
🔧 What Needs to Change in Your Current Page:

Thing	Action
“Output Type” dropdown	❌ Remove – unused and ambiguous
Batch Yield field	❌ Replace with “Final Quantity” in context of unit + product
Product Selector	✅ Add: select from existing products
Variant + Unit	✅ Add: controls for variant and packaging label
Link to ProductInventory	✅ Add in backend logic (done already)
Would you like me to drop this as a patch for your batch_in_progress.html or build it into a new finish_batch.html template and call it from the Finish button?

Here’s the breakdown of your batch-related templates — and yes, you’re right to check:

📂 Batch-Related Templates in Your Project

File	Purpose
batch_in_progress.html	✅ Active batch screen (this is the one you showed in the screenshot)
start_batch.html	Start a new batch from recipe
view_batch.html	✅ Final view of finished batch (used for archive/reporting)
batches_list.html	List of all batches
components/batch/plan_batch.html	Used in plan production flow before batch start
🧩 So What Are We Editing?

Page	Editable?	What You Need
✅ batch_in_progress.html	Yes	Add product/variant/output logic at finish step
✅ view_batch.html	Yes	Show the finished result (read-only, no editing)
✅ Answer:
You should patch batch_in_progress.html to:

Replace the Batch Yield section

Add Product Selection, Variant, Unit, and Quantity input

Feed into the route already patched with ProductInventory support

And later, we’ll update view_batch.html to display the product + output details for finished batches.

Would you like me to drop the exact patch block for batch_in_progress.html now? ​​
