✅ I've created a fresh, unified models.py schema for all batch-related database tables:

Batch

BatchIngredient

BatchContainer

BatchTimer

This is now ready for direct drop-in to Replit. It supports:

Forked logic for ingredient vs product batches

Yield or final quantity depending on type

Inventory-linked deductions

Timer tracking

In-progress saving

👉 Let me know when you're ready for:

The save/cancel/continue route logic

The inventory delta handling

Or the HTML/JS wiring for the batch in progress page.

and mark as failed?

Great catch — let’s add full support for marking a batch as failed, alongside existing statuses.

✅ Updated Batch.status Field
Make sure this enum-like text field supports:

python
Copy
Edit
status = db.Column(db.String(50), default='in_progress')
Allowed values:

Status	Meaning
in_progress	Batch is ongoing
completed	Batch finished successfully
cancelled	Batch was aborted and inventory was restored
failed	Batch failed and will not be packaged or completed
🛠 Optional Route Logic: mark_failed(batch_id)
python
Copy
Edit
@batch_bp.route('/batch/<int:batch_id>/fail', methods=['POST'])
def mark_batch_failed(batch_id):
    batch = Batch.query.get_or_404(batch_id)
    if batch.status != 'in_progress':
        flash("Only in-progress batches can be marked as failed.")
        return redirect(f'/batches/view/{batch_id}')
    
    batch.status = 'failed'
    db.session.commit()
    flash("Batch marked as failed.")
    return redirect('/batches')
📌 You may optionally restore ingredients/containers on fail just like cancel — or leave them deducted if it reflects a loss. Let me know which logic you want.

✅ Add to UI:
Button: “Mark as Failed”

Confirm dialog: “Are you sure this batch failed? This action is final.”

Want me to add this mark_failed route to your backend logic next?






You said:
mark as faild kills the batch but debits inventory. cancel ends the batch, but returns inventory.


ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that’s a clean, production-grade distinction.

✅ Final Batch Status Behaviors

Status	What it means	Inventory Action	Editable?
in_progress	Batch started, mid-process	Inventory already debited	Yes
completed	Batch finished successfully	Inventory stays deducted	No
cancelled	Batch aborted (e.g., wrong ingredients)	Inventory is restored	No
failed	Attempt failed (e.g., spoiled, ruined)	Inventory stays deducted	No
🛠 Action Logic Definitions
🔁 Cancel Batch
python
Copy
Edit
# Restores all batch ingredients and containers back to inventory
batch.status = 'cancelled'
db.session.commit()
❌ Mark as Failed
python
Copy
Edit
# Marks batch as dead. Inventory stays debited.
batch.status = 'failed'
db.session.commit()
✅ UI Button Logic (on /batch/in-progress/<id>)

Button	Action Route	Confirm Message
Save	/batch/save/<id>	—
Finish	/batch/finish/<id>	Confirm: “Mark this batch as completed?”
Cancel	/batch/cancel/<id>	Confirm: “Cancel this batch? Inventory will be restored.”
Mark as Failed	/batch/fail/<id>	Confirm: “Mark this batch as failed? Inventory will stay deducted.”
