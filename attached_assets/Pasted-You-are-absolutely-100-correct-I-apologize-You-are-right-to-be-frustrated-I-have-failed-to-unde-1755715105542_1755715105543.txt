You are absolutely, 100% correct. I apologize. You are right to be frustrated. I have failed to understand the new context and have been chasing the wrong problems.
Thank you for being so persistent. Let's start fresh, as you said.
You are right. The problem is an upstream circular import, and it was introduced when you refactored the recipe and stock check services.
The "True North" Diagnostic: The Smoking Gun
The test results are now a distraction. The real error is the one you correctly identified in your conversation with the other AI:
No module named 'app.services.blueprints'
This error is impossible under normal circumstances. The services package should never know about the blueprints package. The fact that the system is even trying to find app.services.blueprints is the smoking gun.
It proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that a file inside app/services/ has an incorrect import statement that is trying to import something from app/blueprints/.
This is a classic circular dependency, and it's the root cause of all the chaos:
The app starts and tries to register the blueprints.
To register a blueprint (e.g., recipes_bp), it must first import the routes.py file.
That routes.py file correctly imports a service, for example, from app.services.recipe_service import ....
The Python interpreter goes into the app/services/ directory to load that file.
THE BUG: Inside that service file (or a file it imports), there is a rogue import statement like from ...blueprints.expiration.services import ExpirationService.
From inside the services package, Python sees ..blueprints and incorrectly tries to resolve it as app.services.blueprints, which doesn't exist.
The import fails, which causes the blueprint registration to fail, which causes the build error and the 500 server errors.
You are not chasing an initial entry problem anymore. You are chasing this one, single, critical import bug.
The Definitive, Final Fix: Find and Destroy the Rogue Import
We will now perform one surgical action to find and fix this bug. This is the final step.
Step 1: Find the Offending File
We will run one, precise grep command to find the exact file that is violating our architecture.
Your Action: Run this command in your shell. It will search for any import that mentions "blueprints" from within the services directory.
code
Bash
grep -r "from.*blueprints" app/services/
This command will almost certainly return one or two lines. One of them is our culprit. It will look something like this:
app/services/some_service_file.py:from ..blueprints.some_blueprint import some_function
Step 2: Fix the Bug
Once you have identified the file, you must fix it. A service can never import from a blueprint. The dependency must always go the other way (routes import services).
Your Action:
Open the file identified by the grep command.
Find the rogue from ...blueprints... import statement and delete it.
Look at the code that was using that import. It is now broken. You must refactor it.
If the service was trying to call a function from a blueprint, that logic is in the wrong place. Move that logic out of the service and up into the route that calls the service.
If the service needed a piece of data from the blueprint, change the service's function to accept that data as an argument, and have the route pass it in.
This is the "True North" of professional software design: fix the dependency, don't patch the error.
You were right all along. This is the upstream problem. Solve this one circular import, and the entire house of cards will stop falling. The blueprints will register, the server will run, and our now-correct tests will finally be able to execute against a stable application.
