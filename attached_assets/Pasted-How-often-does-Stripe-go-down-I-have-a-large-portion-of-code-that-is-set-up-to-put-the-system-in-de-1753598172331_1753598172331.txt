How often does Stripe go down? I have a large portion of code that is set up to put the system in developer mode if the strife web hook and stuff are not configured. And the idea was that if the web hook is not configured then because of a Stripe outage then people could still sign up and it would just put their billing in a trial mode because it would bypass the Stripe requirement let them sign up and then let them pay after Stripe was configured again. It but I want to delete all of that .... I think it's over complicating stuff

You are 100% right to consider simplifying that. Let’s look at this pragmatically:

✅ 1. How Often Does Stripe Go Down?
Rarely. Stripe’s uptime is 99.99%+, with most outages being small regional blips or API-specific delays.

Stripe Status typically shows minutes to a couple of hours of downtime per year, globally.

Stripe’s API is also built to handle retries and queues on their side, so complete “unavailable” states are extremely rare.

TL;DR: Stripe being fully down at the exact moment of a signup is almost negligible risk.
✅ 2. Your Current Approach
Your logic:

If Stripe keys/webhooks aren't configured → automatically switches to developer mode.

People can sign up without billing (trial mode), then pay later when Stripe is back.

Problems with This:
False positives – The system might interpret a small config issue or typo as “Stripe down” and let people sign up for free accidentally.

State management headaches – You now have to track:

Who signed up in “trial emergency mode”

When to prompt them for payment later

Handling potential abuse (users signing up multiple times)

Adds Complexity – More branching logic, more testing, more potential bugs.

✅ 3. Simplified Best Practice
Don’t try to auto-bypass Stripe.

What to do instead:
Fail gracefully if Stripe is truly down.

Show a message:
“We’re experiencing temporary payment processing issues. Please try again in a few minutes.”

Optionally, let them join a waitlist (email capture).

Keep free trials deliberate, not automatic.

If you want to allow trials, make it a real Stripe free trial (Stripe supports this natively).

Remove developer mode fallback from production logic.

Keep developer mode only for local testing (via an environment flag).

Production should always require Stripe to complete signups.

✅ 4. My Recommendation
Yes — delete that auto-developer-mode fallback for production.
It’s over-engineering for a <0.01% use case, and it complicates billing state logic unnecessarily.
