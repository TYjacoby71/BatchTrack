Yes — based on what you've shared, your ProductSKU system and the Product/ProductVariant structure are not competing — they are complementary and properly integrated.

But let me clarify where confusion might arise, and help you lock down a final architectural direction so you stop fighting your own system.

✅ Here's how your models currently work together (and correctly so):
1. Product = the Parent object
Examples: Royal Tallow, Lavender Candle

Holds shared info like:

Base unit (g, ml)

Categories/tags

Marketplace-level IDs (Shopify product ID)

Relationships: .variants and .skus

2. ProductVariant = the Scent/Flavor/Color
Examples: Lavender, Peppermint, Unscented

Connected to Product via product_id

Groups together SKUs under a variation like scent or finish

Can still have its own attributes (color, material, etc.)

3. ProductSKU = the sellable unit (final form)
Examples: Royal Tallow - Lavender - 4oz Jar

Has all inventory and pricing

Directly linked to:

product_id (parent product)

variant_id (scent/flavor/color)

size_label (e.g. 2oz, 12oz, Bulk)

This is your single source of truth for:

Inventory quantities

Pricing

Batch/Container/Marketplace integration

Unit-level details for labeling, packing, etc.

📌 So… are they competing?
No — they’re a cleanly layered hierarchy:

scss
Copy
Edit
Product (Tallow)
  └── ProductVariant (Lavender)
        └── ProductSKU (Lavender - 4oz Jar)
What you're doing is correct:

You removed the legacy model where Product and Variant were jammed together in a flat SKU table.

Now you're modeling real-world structure → parent → variant → size.

That said, the confusion might come from:

🚩 Where confusion might feel like competition:
Symptom	What's really happening
You feel like you're duplicating data across models	It's intentional: each layer serves a different concern (definition, variation, inventory)
You get migration/index errors like idx_product_variant already exists	The product_variant table is being altered multiple times by separate migrations
Routes or services seem to toggle between ProductService and ProductSKU	You're probably using legacy routes that assume SKU = product, which needs to be updated

🧠 What to do now:
✅ Stick with this hierarchy:
Product → has many ProductVariants

ProductVariant → has many ProductSKUs

🚫 Stop treating SKU as the only model
Yes, it holds inventory and is your sync point for Shopify

But don’t treat it as the definition of a product

Product and Variant should hold naming, categorization, and logic about the identity of the item

🔁 Check for legacy routes or services:
Look for any views, services, or migrations that try to:

Build SKUs without using Product + Variant

Write to old tables like product_sku alone without respecting product_id or variant_id

✅ Summary: You're on the right track
Your model structure is solid now. What you're likely feeling is friction from:

Old code/migrations trying to operate on outdated assumptions (like when ProductSKU was the only thing)

Overloaded responsibilities inside some services (e.g., ProductService or Add Variant still writing SKU records)

Migrations colliding because they reference the same table/index

Want me to clean it up?
If you'd like, I can:

Give you a fresh models.py structure summary

Propose a simplified ProductService that respects this hierarchy
