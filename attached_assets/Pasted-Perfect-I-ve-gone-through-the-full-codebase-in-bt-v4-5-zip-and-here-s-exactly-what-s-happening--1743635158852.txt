Perfect ‚Äî I‚Äôve gone through the full codebase in bt-v4 (5).zip, and here‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening with the "Zero Out" functionality and why it's not saving:

üß† Root Problem
Your zero-out route updates the in-memory data but the save_data() function inside app/utils/data_utils.py is not correctly writing to disk in some contexts (likely due to how paths or imports are handled within your modular blueprint structure).

So, while the function call exists, it's possible it writes to a different or non-visible file, or silently fails ‚Äî especially if the file path is incorrect relative to where the app is being executed.

‚úÖ Fix: Audit and Correct save_data and load_data
Inside app/utils/data_utils.py, confirm this:

python
Copy
Edit
import os
import json

DATA_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../../data.json')

def load_data():
    if not os.path.exists(DATA_FILE):
        return {"ingredients": [], "recipes": []}
    with open(DATA_FILE, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)

def save_data(data):
    with open(DATA_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)
You must ensure DATA_FILE is pointing to the same file globally across all routes. If each module imports data_utils.py in a way that resolves to different working directories, saving will seem to "work" but the data won‚Äôt persist.

‚úÖ Safer Global Fix: Use Flask Config
Set the data file once in your app entry point (main.py or app/__init__.py):

python
Copy
Edit
app.config['DATA_FILE'] = os.path.join(app.root_path, 'data.json')
Then modify your utils to use:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import current_app
import json

def load_data():
    data_file = current_app.config['DATA_FILE']
    if not os.path.exists(data_file):
        return {"ingredients": [], "recipes": []}
    with open(data_file, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)

def save_data(data):
    data_file = current_app.config['DATA_FILE']
    with open(data_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)
üîç Secondary Recommendations
1. Fix Quantity Type Handling
Your quantity field may be saved as a string. Make sure you‚Äôre storing it consistently as a number after zeroing out:

python
Copy
Edit
ingredient['quantity'] = 0.0
2. Enhance the Debug Trail
In routes/stock/routes.py, your zero_out_ingredient() function should have logging:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Zeroing out:", ingredient_name)
print("New quantity:", ingredient['quantity'])
3. Check Replit File System Permissions
Sometimes Replit sandboxes the file system. Try printing os.getcwd() and DATA_FILE in save_data() to ensure it‚Äôs writing where you think.
