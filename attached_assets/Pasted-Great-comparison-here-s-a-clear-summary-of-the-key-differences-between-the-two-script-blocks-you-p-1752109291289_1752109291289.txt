Great comparison — here’s a clear summary of the key differences between the two script blocks you posted:

✅ ADDITIONS in the second version (NEW SCRIPT):
🔁 1. updateExpirationDate()
A new function was added to auto-calculate and populate the expiration date based on shelf_life_days.

js
Copy
Edit
function updateExpirationDate() {
  ...
}
It updates both:

html
Copy
Edit
#expiration_date
#expiration_date_display
🧠 2. Modified toggleShelfLife()
The second version has two definitions of toggleShelfLife() — which can cause issues.

The second definition overrides the first, and slightly changes behavior:

Uses:

js
Copy
Edit
const isPerishable = document.getElementById('is_perishable').checked;
Whereas the first version uses:

js
Copy
Edit
const isPerishable = document.getElementById('is_perishable');
const showShelfLife = isPerishable.checked;
🟡 Issue: You have two versions of toggleShelfLife() — the last one declared will overwrite the previous. You should consolidate or rename to avoid bugs.

📦 3. loadVariants()
New function that dynamically loads product variants via API when a product is selected.

js
Copy
Edit
fetch(`/api/products/${productId}/variants`)
This is useful for the finish batch modal when selecting products → variants.

⚠️ 4. validateContainerInput()
Basic validation for manual entry:

Prevents using more containers than were originally used.

Prevents negative entries.

🧪 5. Full Form Validation on Submit
The submit event on finishBatchModalForm now checks:

Container inputs are valid

final_quantity > 0 if product is selected

❌ REMOVED in the second script:
These were present in the first script only:

updateTotals()

validateContainerAllocation()

These functions validated the relationship between container quantity and final product yield, including overfill/bulk warnings:

js
Copy
Edit
validateContainerAllocation(finalQuantity, totalContainerCapacity);
These also visually alerted users in #yield-validation-alerts.

⚠️ Warning: Removing this removes valuable yield validation UI.

🔁 SHARED BETWEEN BOTH:
toggleShelfLife() (though defined differently)

validateYield()

updateContainerTable()

updateContainerSummary()

updateUncontainedYield()

getCSRFToken()

DOMContentLoaded setup logic

✅ Recommendation
Consolidate and fix these immediately:

🔄 Only define toggleShelfLife() once. Merge the two versions:

js
Copy
Edit
const isPerishable = document.getElementById('is_perishable');
const showShelfLife = isPerishable && isPerishable.checked;
🧠 Restore and keep validateContainerAllocation() unless you've replaced its UI function elsewhere — it's critical for UX and error prevention.

🛠️ Keep the added loadVariants() and validateContainerInput() — they’re valuable, especially for product inventory and Shopify prep.
