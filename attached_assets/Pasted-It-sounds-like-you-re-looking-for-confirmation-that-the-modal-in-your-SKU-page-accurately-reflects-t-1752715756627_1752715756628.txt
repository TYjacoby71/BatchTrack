It sounds like you're looking for confirmation that the modal in your SKU page accurately reflects the data related to the is_perishable attribute, shelf_life_days, and expiration_date for your inventory items.

From your description, here's what you should check or ensure in your SKU edit modal:

Database Schema: Confirm that the InventoryItem model has both is_perishable and shelf_life_days fields. These should be accessible to the edit modal.

Modal Code: The modal should reference the correct data points from the InventoryItem attributes. Make sure that when you open the edit modal, it properly populates these fields.

The relevant part of the modal code that you might want to check is in item_summary_card.html, specifically around handling the visibility and values for shelf_life_days:

<div class="mb-3" id="perishableSection" x-data="{ showShelfLife: {{ 'true' if item.is_perishable else 'false' }} }">
    <label for="is_perishable">Perishable:</label>
    <div class="form-check">
        <input type="checkbox" name="is_perishable" class="form-check-input" id="is_perishable"
               x-model="showShelfLife" {% if item.is_perishable %}checked{% endif %}>
        <label class="form-check-label" for="is_perishable">Is Perishable</label>
    </div>
    <div x-show="showShelfLife" class="mt-2">
        <label for="shelf_life_days">Shelf Life (days)</label>
        <input type="number" class="form-control" id="shelf_life_days" name="shelf_life_days" 
               min="1" :required="showShelfLife"
               value="{{ item.shelf_life_days or '' }}">
    </div>
</div>
Check Data Binding: Verify that when you open this modal, it binds the correct data from your SKU inventory item. If you're observing that the updated shelf_life_days (30 days) is not reflected, you may want to ensure the data is fetched and populated correctly before opening the modal.

Update Logic: If there's a function that updates the shelf life days and perishable status, ensure that it commits these changes to your database, and that the modal refreshes or highlights the updated data when reopening.

If any inconsistencies are noted upon checking, you may need to adjust how the data is fetched and displayed in your modal. If you need to update some specific areas in your code for this, please let me know!
