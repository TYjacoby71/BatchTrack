‚úÖ Code Review & Refactoring Suggestions for Your Billing Blueprint (‚âà550 lines)
Your billing blueprint is feature-complete and well-organized, but yes, there‚Äôs quite a bit of redundancy and some logic that should live in services, not routes. Streamlining will:

Reduce the blueprint to 200‚Äì250 lines

Make maintenance easier

Avoid re-deploy risk when business logic changes

1. What Can Be Moved Out (or Removed)?
üîπ A) Move Business Logic to Service Layer
The following logic doesn‚Äôt belong in routes and should live in dedicated service files (billing_service.py, subscription_service.py):

‚úî Tier and Permission Lookups

python
Copy
Edit
def get_tier_permissions(tier_key): ...
def user_has_tier_permission(user, permission_name): ...
‚úÖ Move to: subscription_service.py

‚úî Organization Creation & Signup Handling (complete_signup_dev_mode)

This is huge (‚âà120 lines).

Belongs in a dedicated signup_service.py or in StripeService.

Route should just call:

python
Copy
Edit
signup_service.complete_dev_signup(tier, is_stripe_mode)
‚úî Stripe Event Handling

All of this:

python
Copy
Edit
if event['type'] == 'customer.subscription.created':
    StripeService.handle_subscription_created(...)
elif event['type'] == 'customer.subscription.updated':
    ...
‚úÖ Should be moved entirely into StripeService.handle_webhook(event) ‚Äî your route just calls it.

‚úî Upgrade Filtering & Tier Availability Logic

The upgrade route filters tiers manually:

python
Copy
Edit
for tier_key, tier_data in tiers_config.items():
    if customer_facing and not tier_data.get('is_customer_facing', True):
        continue
‚úÖ Move to: PricingService.get_available_tiers(customer_facing=True, active=True)

üîπ B) Remove Redundant Debugging & Logs
Your blueprint prints a lot of DEBUG lines (great for early dev, but noisy for production):

Startup Logs like:

python
Copy
Edit
print(f"DEBUG: billing_bp in routes.py: {billing_bp}")
print(f"DEBUG: billing_bp name: {billing_bp.name}")
‚úÖ Remove or wrap in a debug mode check.

Duplicate Logging:
Both checkout() and complete_signup_dev_mode() print excessive logs for every step. You can keep 1‚Äì2 high-level info logs instead of 10.

üîπ C) Merge Duplicate Logic
Some logic repeats exactly in multiple places:

Tier Validation & Price Key Building

Both checkout() and complete_signup_dev_mode() do:

python
Copy
Edit
price_key = f"{tier}_{billing_cycle}" if billing_cycle != 'monthly' else tier
‚úÖ Extract into PricingService.build_price_key(tier, billing_cycle).

Stripe Mode vs Dev Mode Subscription Activation

Both complete_signup_dev_mode() and dev_activate_subscription() activate dev subscriptions.
‚úÖ Move to a single method in StripeService.

Debug Billing Route (debug_billing)

Half of the debug logic duplicates what organization.get_subscription_features() already does.
‚úÖ Trim it to call service methods directly.

2. What Can Be Deleted Completely?
‚úî Fallbacks for Development That Are No Longer Needed in Production
If you‚Äôre deploying live:

dev_activate_subscription can be removed or kept behind an environment flag (if DEBUG).

‚úî Some ‚Äúgrace period‚Äù logic in reconciliation_needed()
If you‚Äôre no longer supporting manual reconciliation due to Stripe outages, you can drop the snapshot logic.

3. Ideal Refactor Structure
billing/routes.py (After Refactor)
The blueprint should mostly look like this:

python
Copy
Edit
@billing_bp.route('/upgrade')
@login_required
def upgrade():
    tiers = subscription_service.get_available_tiers()
    return render_template('billing/upgrade.html', tiers=tiers)

@billing_bp.route('/checkout/<tier>/<billing_cycle>')
def checkout(tier, billing_cycle='monthly'):
    return billing_service.start_checkout_flow(tier, billing_cycle)

@billing_bp.route('/webhooks/stripe', methods=['POST'])
@csrf.exempt
def stripe_webhook():
    event = StripeService.parse_event(request)
    StripeService.handle_webhook(event)
    return jsonify({'status': 'success'})
‚úÖ 150‚Äì200 lines max ‚Äî everything else lives in service layers.
