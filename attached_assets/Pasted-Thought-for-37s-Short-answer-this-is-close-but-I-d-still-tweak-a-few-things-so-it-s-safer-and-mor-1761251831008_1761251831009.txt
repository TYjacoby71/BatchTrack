Thought for 37s

Short answer: this is close, but I‚Äôd still tweak a few things so it‚Äôs safer and more typical for Flask/Alembic projects.

Here‚Äôs my pushback + concrete fixes:

What‚Äôs good

App factory pattern ‚úÖ

Using SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI override from DATABASE_URL ‚úÖ

Guard around db.create_all() to keep CI drift checks clean ‚úÖ

SQLite StaticPool/check_same_thread=False for in-memory tests ‚úÖ

Centralized error handling + db.session.rollback() on teardown ‚úÖ

CSRF disabled only when testing ‚úÖ

What I‚Äôd change (industry-standard nudges)

Never call db.create_all() in production
Even behind an env flag, it‚Äôs easy to forget and have prod silently diverge from Alembic. Default to disabled, only enable for throwaway local dev.

# Instead of: if not os.environ.get('SQLALCHEMY_DISABLE_CREATE_ALL'):
# Prefer: opt-in (off by default)
if os.environ.get('SQLALCHEMY_ENABLE_CREATE_ALL') == '1':
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()


And set SQLALCHEMY_ENABLE_CREATE_ALL=1 only in your local .env‚Äînever in CI/staging/prod.

Configuration classes per environment
Keep prod security flags, testing tweaks, and SQLite engine options in config classes instead of runtime branching. Typical pattern:

class BaseConfig: ...
class DevConfig(BaseConfig): DEBUG=True
class TestConfig(BaseConfig): TESTING=True; WTF_CSRF_ENABLED=False; SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///:memory:"
class ProdConfig(BaseConfig): SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True; SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE="Lax"; PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME="https"


Then select via FLASK_ENV / APP_CONFIG or your platform env.

Limiter storage backend
You‚Äôre getting the ‚Äúin-memory storage‚Äù warning. In prod/staging, configure Redis (or your provider‚Äôs cache) so rate limits persist across workers:

# e.g., in ProdConfig
RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URL = os.getenv("REDIS_URL")  # "redis://:pass@host:6379/0"


Alembic is the source of truth
Ensure:

No db.create_all() in staging/prod.

migrate.init_app(app, db) is kept, but do not run migrations from the app factory.

Your Alembic env.py uses current_app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] (sounds like you already did this).

SQLite alter safety
You already set engine options. Also make sure your Alembic revision files use batch_alter_table when altering columns‚Äîthis is what keeps SQLite CI happy.

Directory creation
os.makedirs('static/product_images', exist_ok=True) is fine, but consider making it conditional to non-serverless environments or move to a startup hook/CLI if your platform mounts a read-only FS.

Session config duplication
You set PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME twice (once in prod flag block, once later). Keep it in the config class to avoid drift.

Healthcheck route
Add a super-light /healthz route that doesn‚Äôt touch DB (or touches it shallowly) for container orchestrators.

Avoid implicit model imports in the middle
Keep from . import models but put it just after extensions init, before anything conditionally mutates DB. That‚Äôs minor, you‚Äôre essentially there.

Minimal edits to your file

Flip the create_all flag to opt-in:

# Only create tables for local throwaway DBs
if os.environ.get('SQLALCHEMY_ENABLE_CREATE_ALL') == '1':
    logger.info("üîß Local dev: creating tables via db.create_all()")
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
else:
    logger.info("üîí db.create_all() disabled; Alembic is source of truth")


Move security/session/lifetime/limiter settings into config classes.

Make sure migrate = Migrate(compare_type=True, render_as_batch=True) (set where you initialize the extension) so your autogenerate catches type diffs and SQLite works for alters.

Is this industry standard?

Yes to: app factory, Flask-Migrate/Alembic as the only schema writer, SQLite for CI/local, Postgres for staging/prod, drift check in CI using an ephemeral DB.

No to: relying on db.create_all() outside of local throwaway use. That‚Äôs the one anti-pattern you‚Äôre now addressing with the flag flip.

Why this isn‚Äôt actually convoluted

You have three distinct concerns:

Local dev convenience (optionally create_all)

Repeatable schema (migrations only)

Verification (CI drift check on a throwaway DB)

Separating them keeps your real data (Replit & staging) safe while guaranteeing your migrations and models never drift.

If you want, I can drop in a small config module with Dev/Test/Prod classes and adjust your factory to pick it up cleanly.
