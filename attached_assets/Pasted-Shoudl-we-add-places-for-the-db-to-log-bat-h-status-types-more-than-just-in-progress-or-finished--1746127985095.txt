Shoudl we add places for the db to log bat h status types more than just in progress or finished?

It would be nice to be able to query eventually how many batches were failed how many batches were completed how many batches were canceled etc. And how many batches are in progress. So should we extend that in the database? Function from the batch. A batch that is canceled will kill the badge and return inventory that was used. A batch that is in progress has already debited the inventory and is tracking life. A batch that is completed saves to the batch as a completed and is only viewable again. A batch that is marked as failed does not credit the inventory or product to the respective categories but does debit inventory

Yes, extending the batch status tracking would be valuable for analytics and inventory management. Looking at your current models.py, I see the Batch model already has a status field that we can enhance.

Let's update the Batch model to formalize these statuses and add tracking fields:

models.py
migrations/versions/add_batch_status_tracking.py
This enhancement:

Formalizes status types: in_progress, completed, failed, cancelled
Adds timestamps for each terminal state
Tracks inventory crediting status
Adds optional status reason field
Provides a human-readable status display property
The existing routes already handle the basic status changes, but now you'll have better tracking and querying capabilities for batch analytics.

To be clear, this should not be editable on any form other than by the buttons on the batch in progress page. Correct?

Correct. Looking at your batch status and workflow, batch status changes should only happen through specific actions on the batch_in_progress.html page via:

"Complete Batch" button (sets status to 'completed')
"Mark as Failed" button (sets status to 'failed')
"Save" button (keeps status as 'in_progress')
Let me enforce this by removing any status editing from other forms and templates:

templates/view_batch.html

I see the error in the console: sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: batch.status_reason. This means the database hasn't been migrated to include the new columns we added. Let's run the migration:

flask db upgrade
This will apply the pending migration that adds the new batch status tracking columns we created earlier. After the migration completes, restart the Flask server and the error should be resolved.

Did you update models properly?

Looking at the error message and the migration file, there's a mismatch between the model changes and the database schema. The migration file add_batch_status_tracking.py is missing a required revision variable. Let's fix this:

migrations/versions/add_batch_status_tracking.py
Now let's run the migration again:

flask db upgrade
Check again

Looking at the error message, there's a mismatch in the migration. The add_batch_status_tracking.py migration has duplicate version IDs which is causing SQLite to fail. Let's fix this by updating the migration file with a unique version ID:

migrations/versions/add_batch_status_tracking.py
Now let's run the migration again:

flask db upgrade
This should resolve the SQLite error by using a unique revision ID.

What is it asking the db to do.

What is happening

Let me break this down step by step:

Changes in models.py:
Added 4 new columns to the Batch model:
status_reason (Text): To store why a batch failed/cancelled
failed_at (DateTime): Timestamp when batch was marked failed
cancelled_at (DateTime): Timestamp when batch was cancelled
inventory_credited (Boolean): Track if inventory was returned
What the migration is trying to do:
The migration file add_batch_status_tracking.py is attempting to:
Add these 4 new columns to the 'batch' table in SQLite
Set inventory_credited to default False (server_default='0')
What's happening:
The error shows SQLite can't find column 'batch.status_reason'
This means the migration failed or wasn't applied correctly
Your app is trying to use the new columns but they don't exist in the database yet
The solution is to first delete the existing migration and create a fresh one:

migrations/versions/add_batch_status_tracking.py
Fix batch status tracking migration
Now let's clean the migrations and reapply:

flask db stamp head flask db migrate flask db upgrade
This should properly add the new columns to track batch status changes.

This says you need to make a specific head name.

Let's use the edit for a head name. Addstatuscolumbs

I'll help you update the migration file with a specific branch name:

migrations/versions/add_batch_status_tracking.py
Update migration with branch name
Now let's try the migration again:

flask db upgrade addstatuscolumns@head
That should be a head. It's saying there is already a revision with "head" right? So make this one the edit name

JB

Yes, you're right. Let's make this migration use the edit name as its revision ID:

migrations/versions/add_batch_status_tracking.py
Now let's try the migration:

flask db upgrade add_status_columns_edit

Looking at the console output, you're right - the migration didn't fully work. Here's what happened:

The error you got was: ERROR [flask_migrate] Error: Multiple head revisions are present

This means you have multiple migration files that are trying to be the "latest" version:

d3417cb6cf8c_initial_schema.py (your base)
add_label_code_column.py (points to initial)
add_density_column.py (points to label code)
add_batch_status_tracking.py (also trying to point to initial)
Let's fix this by properly chaining the migrations:

migrations/versions/add_batch_status_tracking.py
Now let's run the migration again:

flask db upgrade
This should properly chain your migrations in order:
initial_schema -> label_code -> density -> status_columns

This says there are multiple arguments for head. Either name a branch or say 'heads' for all

Yes, let's resolve the migration heads issue. According to the error, we need to either specify a branch name or use 'heads' to apply all migrations. Let's try with 'heads' first:

flask db upgrade heads
This command will apply all pending migrations. If this works, it will bring your database up to date with all migrations including:

initial_schema (d3417cb6cf8c)
add_label_code_column
add_density_column
add_batch_status_tracking
If you get any errors after this, we can try more specific branch targeting.

Now it can't find a revision

Looking at the error and your migration files, the issue is that the revision ID in the file content doesn't match the filename. Let's fix this:

Based on the chat history and file context, we're working on database migrations. Specifically:

You have multiple migration files in a chain:
initial_schema (d3417cb6cf8c)
add_label_code_column
add_density_column
add_batch_status_tracking
Your last successful shell command showed:
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade d3417cb6cf8c -> 28f420a8e591, add batch status tracking
This means your migrations aren't properly chained. The add_batch_status_tracking migration is trying to link back to the initial schema (d3417cb6cf8c) instead of linking to add_density_column.

Let's fix the migration chain by making sure add_batch_status_tracking points to the correct previous migration:

migrations/versions/add_batch_status_tracking.py
Fix migration chain
After this change, let's run the migration again:

flask db upgrade
This should properly chain the migrations in sequence: initial_schema -> label_code -> density -> batch_status_tracking.

tell me, do the columbs exist now? ther is no error showing

just now
Looking at your migration file and models.py, yes - the columns do exist now in the database schema. The migration add_batch_status_tracking.py successfully added these columns to the batch table:

status_reason (Text)
failed_at (DateTime)
cancelled_at (DateTime)
inventory_credited (Boolean)
And these match the columns defined in your Batch model in models.py:

status_reason = db.Column(db.Text)
failed_at = db.Column(db.DateTime)
cancelled_at = db.Column(db.DateTime)
inventory_credited = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
