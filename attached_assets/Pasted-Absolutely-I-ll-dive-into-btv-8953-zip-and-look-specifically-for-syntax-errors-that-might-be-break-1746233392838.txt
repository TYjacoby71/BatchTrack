Absolutely ‚Äî I‚Äôll dive into btv-8953.zip and look specifically for syntax errors that might be breaking or misrendering the container dropdown or other batch planning logic.

Please confirm one of the following:

Do you want me to scan the entire btv-8953.zip for syntax errors broadly (HTML, JS, Python)?

Or are we specifically targeting a known page, like /recipes/plan/<id> or plan_production.html?

I'll start scanning the codebase for syntax errors now.

‚úÖ No syntax errors were found in any of the Python files in btv-8953.zip.

Next, I‚Äôll scan the HTML and JavaScript files for common syntax issues like:

Unclosed tags or missing braces

JS reference errors or malformed functions

Misplaced Jinja logic ({% %} or {{ }} blocks)

Proceeding to that now. 

Here are the HTML files with likely syntax issues due to mismatched < > brackets ‚Äî often a sign of unclosed or malformed HTML tags:

‚ö†Ô∏è Suspected HTML Syntax Errors (Mismatched < > Tags):
File	Issue
quick_add_ingredient_modal.html	Unmatched or unclosed tag
batch_in_progress.html	Likely a broken tag in structure
dashboard.html	Tag mismatch detected
inventory_list.html	HTML structure may be off
layout.html	Core layout may have an unclosed tag
plan_production.html ‚úÖ	This is where your container dropdown lives
recipe_form.html	Could impact modal rendering
components/batch/start_flow.html	Likely visual issue in batch wizard

‚úÖ Next Step Options
Would you like me to:

Pinpoint the issue in plan_production.html and fix the exact syntax problem now?

Audit all 8 files and return full before/after fixes as a batch?

Let me know and I‚Äôll proceed with the cleanup immediately.

Here's the key snippet from batch_in_progress.html surrounding the "Save" button:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Submission Buttons -->
<div class="button-group mt-4 d-flex justify-content-between">
    <div>
        <button type="button" onclick="saveBatch(event)" class="btn btn-primary me-2">Save</button>
        <a href="{{ url_for('batches.list_batches') }}" class="btn btn-secondary">Exit</a>
    </div>
    <div class="d-flex gap-2">
üîç Issue:
The final <div class="d-flex gap-2"> is not closed anywhere in this snippet.

This unclosed <div> is the likely cause of the mismatched < > count.

‚úÖ Fix:
Add a closing </div> for that d-flex gap-2 container.

‚úÖ Corrected Version:
html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Submission Buttons -->
<div class="button-group mt-4 d-flex justify-content-between">
    <div>
        <button type="button" onclick="saveBatch(event)" class="btn btn-primary me-2">Save</button>
        <a href="{{ url_for('batches.list_batches') }}" class="btn btn-secondary">Exit</a>
    </div>
    <div class="d-flex gap-2">
        <!-- ... other buttons probably go here ... -->
    </div> <!-- ‚úÖ Close this -->
</div>
Let me know if you'd like me to auto-patch this file or check for similar unclosed tags across the others.
