his is where we are at. Still no saved data... why is this a problem?

Thanks ‚Äî you're being incredibly thorough, and that helps a lot.

You're doing everything right on the front end, but the back end is not saving any of the extra data (even though it's receiving it). Here's a precise breakdown of what‚Äôs going wrong and how to fix it.

üö® Root Cause: The Backend Ignores the Form Data
In your HTML, you're submitting a lot of meaningful fields:

output_type

product_id

variant_label

output_unit

final_quantity

ingredient_unit

ingredient_quantity

extra_ingredients[]

extra_amounts[]

extra_units[]

extra_containers[]

extra_container_amounts[]

batch_timers[]

notes

tags

BUT the backend finish_batch route only saves notes and tags ‚Äî nothing else is being written to the database.

‚úÖ Solution: Extend the finish_batch Route to Save All Inputs
You need to update your route like this:

python
Copy
Edit
@batches_bp.route('/finish/<int:batch_id>', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def finish_batch(batch_id, force=False):
    batch = Batch.query.get_or_404(batch_id)
    action = request.form.get('action')

    if action == 'save':
        # Basic fields
        batch.notes = request.form.get('notes', '')
        batch.tags = request.form.get('tags', '')
        batch.output_type = request.form.get('output_type')
        batch.product_id = request.form.get('product_id') or None
        batch.variant_label = request.form.get('variant_label') or ''
        batch.output_unit = request.form.get('output_unit') or request.form.get('ingredient_unit')
        batch.final_quantity = request.form.get('final_quantity') or request.form.get('ingredient_quantity')

        # Extra ingredients
        ingredients = zip(
            request.form.getlist('extra_ingredients[]'),
            request.form.getlist('extra_amounts[]'),
            request.form.getlist('extra_units[]'),
        )
        for name, amount, unit in ingredients:
            if name.strip():
                ing = ExtraIngredient(
                    batch_id=batch.id,
                    name=name,
                    amount=float(amount or 0),
                    unit=unit,
                )
                db.session.add(ing)

        # Extra containers
        containers = zip(
            request.form.getlist('extra_containers[]'),
            request.form.getlist('extra_container_amounts[]'),
        )
        for name, qty in containers:
            if name.strip():
                cont = BatchContainer(
                    batch_id=batch.id,
                    name=name,
                    quantity=float(qty or 0),
                )
                db.session.add(cont)

        # Timers
        for time_str in request.form.getlist('batch_timers[]'):
            if time_str:
                new_timer = BatchTimer(
                    batch_id=batch.id,
                    target_time=datetime.strptime(time_str, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M'),
                    completed=False
                )
                db.session.add(new_timer)

        try:
            db.session.commit()
            flash("Changes saved successfully", "success")
            return redirect(url_for('batches.list_batches'))
        except Exception as e:
            db.session.rollback()
            flash(f"Error saving changes: {str(e)}", "error")
            return redirect(url_for('batches.view_batch_in_progress', batch_identifier=batch.id))
üì¶ What's Missing in Your Current Code
No code to save the product_id, variant_label, output_type, or final_quantity

No models like ExtraIngredient, BatchContainer, or BatchTimer being created

No session db.session.add(...) for any new objects

üõ†Ô∏è What You Need to Do
Confirm your models: ExtraIngredient, BatchContainer, BatchTimer exist and are related to Batch

Apply the finish_batch logic above

Commit and test

Would you like me to inspect or generate those model classes next?

You said:
it shouldnt go to finish batch. finish batch is a snapshot page only of a completed batch...it is only accesible once complete batch is hit. 

Although, i guess it could be used as an invisible reference page until its called for real.. 

What do you think?


ChatGPT said:
Ah ‚Äî thanks for the clarification. That changes the strategy.

You're right to pause and reconsider, and here's a detailed breakdown to help decide:

üîÑ Your Options: Saving Logic Location
‚úÖ Option 1: Keep Using finish_batch for "Save and Exit"
Pros:

Minimal code duplication ‚Äî one endpoint handles both saving and finishing

Already wired to the form

Can silently skip finalization logic unless action == "finish"

Cons:

Name is misleading (it suggests finalization, not saving drafts)

Might clutter with too many conditionals

How to make it clean:

Rename the route internally to something like save_or_finish_batch

Make "finishing" just one case (action == "finish")

Keep "saving" (action == "save") light and draft-like

‚úÖ Option 2: Create a Dedicated /save_progress/<batch_id> Route
Pros:

Explicit and clean separation of concerns

Makes routes easier to maintain and test

Cons:

You'll duplicate logic unless you extract a common update_batch_from_form() helper function

ü§ñ My Recommendation (As Your Code Teammate)
I‚Äôd go with Option 1, but clean it up:

Keep your form pointing to batches.finish_batch

Inside the route, clearly separate "save" and "finish" branches

Move snapshot logic, costing, and irreversible updates into the "finish" branch only

Consider renaming the route or aliasing it for clarity (e.g. save_or_finish_batch in the view function, but keep the URL path)

This gives you:

One place for saving batch data

Predictable behavior for "Save & Exit"

Reuse without confusing the user or yourself later
