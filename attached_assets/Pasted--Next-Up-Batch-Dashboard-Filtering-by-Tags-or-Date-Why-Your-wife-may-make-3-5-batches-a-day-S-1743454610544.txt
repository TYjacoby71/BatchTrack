✅ Next Up: Batch Dashboard + Filtering by Tags or Date
Why?

Your wife may make 3–5 batches a day

She may want to:

Quickly find a batch she ran last week

Search by tag ("lavender", "face balm", "holiday")

🛠 What This Will Add:
A filter/search form at the top of /batches

Optional filters:

✅ By tag (contains / match)

✅ By recipe

✅ By date range

Results update dynamically

✅ Replit Instructions — Copy & Paste
🧾 Add Filters to batches.html
php-template
Copy
Edit
Please update `batches.html` to support filtering.

1. Add this above the batch table:

```html
<h2>Batches</h2>

<form method="get">
  <label for="tag">Tag contains:</label>
  <input type="text" name="tag" value="{{ request.args.get('tag', '') }}">
  
  <label for="recipe">Recipe name contains:</label>
  <input type="text" name="recipe" value="{{ request.args.get('recipe', '') }}">

  <input type="submit" value="Filter">
  <a href="/batches">Reset</a>
</form>
<br>
Below the filter, render a table of filtered batches like normal.

yaml
Copy

### 🧾 Add Filtering Logic to `view_batches()` in `batches.py`

Please update the /batches route in batches.py:

python
Copy
Edit
@batches_bp.route('/batches')
def view_batches():
    data = load_data()
    batches = data.get('batches', [])
    tag_filter = request.args.get("tag", "").lower()
    recipe_filter = request.args.get("recipe", "").lower()

    if tag_filter:
        batches = [b for b in batches if any(tag_filter in t.lower() for t in b.get("tags", []))]

    if recipe_filter:
        batches = [b for b in batches if recipe_filter in b.get("recipe_name", "").lower()]

    return render_template('batches.html', batches=batches)
yaml
Copy
