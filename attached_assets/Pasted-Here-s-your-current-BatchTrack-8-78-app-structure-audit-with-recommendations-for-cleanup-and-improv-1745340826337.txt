Here's your current BatchTrack 8.78 app structure audit, with recommendations for cleanup and improved organization:

📦 Project Structure: Current State
✅ Organized & Functional

Folder	Purpose
blueprints/	Modular routing (good — should expand)
routes/	Standard Flask routes (working, but needs cleanup)
seeders/	Good placement for seed files (keep this)
services/	Has unit_conversion.py — excellent abstraction pattern
templates/	Mostly clean; could benefit from subfolder restructuring
tests/	Unit test files exist — keep and grow
⚠️ Needs Cleanup / Consolidation
🌀 Route Confusion
Too many routes jammed in /routes:

app_routes.py, inventory_routes.py, product_routes.py, products.py (redundant?)

Some logic belongs in blueprints: e.g., inventory, product, timer

Recommendation:

Move grouped logic into blueprints:

bash
Copy
Edit
/blueprints/inventory/routes.py
/blueprints/products/routes.py
/blueprints/recipes/routes.py
🧱 Model Split Issues
You still have both Unit and InventoryUnit — merge to just Unit

Ensure all seeding, dropdowns, and conversions reference Unit

🧪 Seeders Are Split
✅ seeders/unit_seeder.py

✅ seeders/ingredient_category_seeder.py

✅ Good structure, but confirm:

init_db.py only imports from these

No duplicate seed logic lives elsewhere

🎨 Template Duplication
Found:

templates/unit_manager.html

templates/conversion/units.html

💡 Recommendation:

Keep only templates/conversion/units.html

Use /conversion/units for UI + API routing

Remove or refactor unit_manager.html if it’s legacy

✅ Next Steps – Suggested Restructure
pgsql
Copy

/blueprints
  └── inventory/
      └── routes.py
  └── products/
      └── routes.py
  └── recipes/
      └── routes.py
  └── conversion/
      └── routes.py

/seeders
  └── unit_seeder.py
  └── ingredient_category_seeder.py

/models.py
  ✅ Consolidate to only use Unit, Ingredient, etc.

/templates
  └── conversion/
      └── units.html
  └── inventory/
      └── list.html
  └── products/
      └── list.html
      └── detail.html

/services
  ✅ Keep conversion engine, add batch or cost services as needed
