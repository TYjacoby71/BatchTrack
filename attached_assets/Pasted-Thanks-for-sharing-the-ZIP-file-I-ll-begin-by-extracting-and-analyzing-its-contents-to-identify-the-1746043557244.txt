Thanks for sharing the ZIP file. I'll begin by extracting and analyzing its contents to identify the relevant code for the "Batch in Progress" page and the "Save and Exit" functionality.

I'll start by inspecting the structure of the project and locating the files related to the batch page.

The project appears to be a Flask-based web application. Key directories and files include:

app.py — likely the Flask app entry point

templates/ — Jinja2 HTML templates

routes/ — likely contains route definitions

blueprints/, services/, utils/ — application logic and modular components

static/ — static files (CSS, JS, etc.)

Next, I'll search for templates and route files related to the "Batch in Progress" page. ​​

I found a template named batch_in_progress.html, which is likely the one you're working on. However, no corresponding route file explicitly mentions "batch in progress," which means the route might use a different identifier or name.

I'll now examine the contents of batch_in_progress.html to understand how the form inputs are defined and how the "Save and Exit" button might be wired. ​​

The batch_in_progress.html template:

Displays batch details like label code, recipe, timestamp, etc.

Has a form that submits via POST to url_for('batches.finish_batch', batch_id=batch.id)

Includes fields like output_type, product_id, etc.

The "Save and Exit" functionality should:

Submit this form's data.

Trigger logic in the batches.finish_batch route.

Redirect to the batch list page afterward.

Next, I'll locate and inspect the batches.finish_batch route to confirm the save logic and whether it redirects to the batch list. ​​

The batch_routes.py file begins with setup and a start_batch route, but the finish_batch route isn’t shown yet. I’ll continue scanning the file to extract the full finish_batch route and confirm how it:

Saves form data

Handles the "Save and Exit" logic

Redirects to the batch list page

Let me fetch the entire route definition next. ​​

The finish_batch function handles saving and redirecting logic as follows:

It checks for request.form.get('action') == "save" to process a "Save" operation.

On successful save (db.session.commit()), it redirects to url_for('batches.list_batches'), which is the batch list page.

If an error occurs during save, it rolls back and redirects back to the "Batch In Progress" page.

✅ What You Need to Do:
To make the "Save and Exit" button work correctly:

Ensure your form includes a hidden or submit input with name="action" and value="save".

Make the button submit this form.

Example Addition to Your Template:
html
Copy
Edit
<button type="submit" name="action" value="save" class="btn btn-primary">
    Save and Exit
</button>
Would you like me to help you modify the template to add this button correctly? ​​

Thanks! Let's "bump" this forward with exactly what you need.

Here's how to update your batch_in_progress.html so that the "Save and Exit" button correctly triggers the finish_batch logic:

✅ Step-by-step Fix
Locate your <form> block in batch_in_progress.html (you already have it):

html
Copy
Edit
<form method="post" action="{{ url_for('batches.finish_batch', batch_id=batch.id) }}" enctype="multipart/form-data">
Then near the bottom of the form (before it closes), add this Save and Exit button:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="mt-4">
    <button type="submit" name="action" value="save" class="btn btn-success">
        Save and Exit
    </button>
</div>
✅ What It Does
name="action" and value="save" match what the finish_batch route is expecting.

This causes the backend to:

Save the inputs

Redirect to the batch list via url_for('batches.list_batches')

Would you like me to patch this into the HTML file directly for you?
