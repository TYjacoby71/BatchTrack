You’re close — and your approach is directionally correct — but let’s refine it to ensure:

✅ It works cleanly in your system

✅ It avoids future problems

✅ It maps directly to Shopify's model

✅ Correct Approach Summary
You want:

1. Unified Inventory Control via InventoryItem
All inventory counts (ingredients, containers, products) live in one table

FIFO, spoilage, recounts, and adjustments all use one adjustment system

2. ProductSKU as a Label + Metadata
Each sellable unit (SKU) is a child of an InventoryItem with type='product'

SKU includes:

variant_name, size_label

sku_code

retail_price, wholesale_price

Marketplace IDs (Shopify, Etsy, etc.)

3. One-to-One Link between ProductSKU and InventoryItem
python
Copy
Edit
class ProductSKU(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('inventory_item.id'), primary_key=True)
    inventory = db.relationship('InventoryItem', backref=db.backref('sku', uselist=False))
🛠 Shopify Model Comparison
Shopify uses:

Concept	Shopify	BatchTrack Equivalent
Product	Product	Product
Variant	Variant	ProductVariant
SKU	Variant SKU	ProductSKU
Inventory	InventoryItem	InventoryItem with type='product'
Inventory Level	Per location	FIFO + quantity tracking

✅ Your model aligns well with Shopify. Each Shopify variant has:

A parent product

A SKU code

A price

A quantity (per location) — same as your FIFO inventory tracking

So:
👉 ProductSKU maps to Shopify Variant
👉 InventoryItem maps to Shopify Inventory
👉 Your Product and Variant classes map 1:1

🚨 What to Avoid (Pitfalls)
Problem	Explanation
❌ Two separate quantities	If both SKU and InventoryItem track quantity, they will fall out of sync
❌ Inventory logic in SKU	Keep all math in InventoryItem and InventoryHistory
❌ SKU without Inventory	Make sure every SKU maps to a real InventoryItem with type='product'
❌ Batch writing to both	All finished_batch logic should call adjust_inventory() on InventoryItem

✅ Will This Cause Problems?
If you implement as above — no, it will prevent problems:

🚫 No duplicate quantities

🚫 No fragmented FIFO history

🚫 No separate perishable tracking

✅ Shopify sync ready (via sku_code, shopify_variant_id)

✅ Easy future expansion to Square, Etsy, etc.

✅ Recommendation
💡 Yes — this is the correct approach.

You’re almost there. Just make sure:

ProductSKU.id = InventoryItem.id (type='product')

Remove current_quantity, reserved_quantity from ProductSKU

All routes use adjust_inventory() on InventoryItem

Add SKU metadata like retail price to ProductSKU
