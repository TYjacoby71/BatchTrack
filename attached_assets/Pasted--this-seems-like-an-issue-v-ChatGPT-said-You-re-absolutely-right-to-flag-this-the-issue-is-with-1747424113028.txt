You're absolutely right to flag this ‚Äî the issue is with this line on the far right (new version):

python
Copy
Edit
return redirect(url_for('inventory.list_inventory'))
But... there‚Äôs no route function named list_inventory defined in your blueprint.

üî• What's Happening
You're trying to redirect to a route named 'inventory.list_inventory', but based on your routes, your main page function is likely called:

python
Copy
Edit
@inventory_bp.route('/')
def inventory():
Which means its endpoint name is inventory.inventory, not list_inventory.

‚úÖ Fix This Line:
Change:

python
Copy
Edit
return redirect(url_for('inventory.list_inventory'))
To:

python
Copy
Edit
return redirect(url_for('inventory.inventory'))
‚úÖ This will redirect properly to /inventory/ and avoid a BuildError.

üß† Tip: How Flask Names Endpoints
Unless you explicitly add endpoint="...", Flask auto-names them like:

Copy
Edit
blueprint_name.view_function_name
So:

python
Copy
Edit
@inventory_bp.route('/')
def inventory():
Is referenced via:

python
Copy
Edit
url_for('inventory.inventory')
Would you like me to scan your routes and flag any other url_for() references that are out of sync with their function names?






You said:
i thought it was invetory list?

Great instinct ‚Äî you're picking up on the naming confusion between the route function name and the template file name.

Let‚Äôs clarify it with hard definitions from your app:

üîç You‚Äôre Using This Route:
python
Copy
Edit
@inventory_bp.route('/')
def inventory():
This means the route function name is literally inventory.

Flask auto-generates the endpoint name as:
python
Copy
Edit
'inventory.inventory'
So this:

python
Copy
Edit
return redirect(url_for('inventory.inventory'))
‚úÖ will work.

üß© Where the Confusion Comes From:
Your template is named:

Copy
Edit
inventory_list.html
Which is totally fine ‚Äî that's the template name, not the route name.

You're rendering it like this:

python
Copy
Edit
render_template('inventory_list.html')
But that does not define an endpoint named inventory.list_inventory.

üß† If You Want to Rename It More Clearly:
You can rename the function to make things match:

python
Copy
Edit
@inventory_bp.route('/')
def list_inventory():
    ...
Then your redirect will correctly be:

python
Copy
Edit
url_for('inventory.list_inventory')
‚úÖ That would make your template, route function, and endpoint all consistently named as list_inventory.

üí¨ Final Answer:
If you want your current code to work right now:

python
Copy
Edit
return redirect(url_for('inventory.inventory'))
If you want to make the naming clearer and match the template:

Rename the function to list_inventory

Then the endpoint becomes inventory.list_inventory
