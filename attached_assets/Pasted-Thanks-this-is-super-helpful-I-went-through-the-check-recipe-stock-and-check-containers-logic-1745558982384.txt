Thanks ‚Äî this is super helpful. I went through the check_recipe_stock() and check_containers() logic thoroughly, and here's your detailed answer.

‚úÖ Summary of What the Code Does
check_recipe_stock(recipe, scale)
Takes a recipe and a scale multiplier

For each ingredient:

Checks if ingredient.inventory_item is set

Converts units via UnitConversionService.convert(...)

Constructs a StockCheckResult

Returns:

a list of stock results

and whether any conversion issues occurred

üîç What Can Go Wrong? (And What‚Äôs Likely Breaking)
‚ùå 1. UnitConversionService.convert(...) fails
If ingredient.unit or inventory_item.unit is missing, malformed, or unconvertible, this will raise an exception:

python
Copy
Edit
needed_converted = UnitConversionService.convert(...)  # ‚Üê could raise
‚úÖ You're catching it ‚Äî but the result won‚Äôt appear in the stock check, and you'll get conversion_issues = True.

‚ùå 2. scale <= 0 or not float(scale)
From your error:

"Something about the scale input on plan production seems unset"

That's probably this check:

python
Copy
Edit
if scale <= 0:
    raise ValueError("Scale must be greater than 0")
This raises an exception and aborts stock check. It‚Äôs very likely if the JS doesn't send scale properly (or sends "NaN", or empty string "").

‚úÖ How to Confirm What‚Äôs Causing It
Add Logging:
In your Flask route (/api/check-stock), right before calling check_recipe_stock(...):

python
Copy
Edit
logging.info(f"[StockCheck] Recipe ID: {recipe_id}, Scale: {scale}, Container IDs: {container_ids}")
In check_recipe_stock():

python
Copy
Edit
logger.debug(f"Checking stock for recipe {recipe.id} at scale {scale}")
‚úÖ Answer to Your Question
Is it the recipe? Containers? Scale input?

Most Likely: The scale input
It's a free-type input box (<input type="number">), so if the JS sends an empty value or string (e.g. "", "NaN"), the API sees:

python
Copy
Edit
scale = float("")  # ‚Üê raises ValueError
‚úÖ This triggers your ValueError("Scale must be greater than 0"), which causes a 400.

‚úÖ Fix in JS (checkProductionStock())
Patch the scale parsing like this:

js
Copy
Edit
const scaleRaw = document.querySelector('input[name="scale"]')?.value;
const scale = parseFloat(scaleRaw);
if (isNaN(scale) || scale <= 0) {
  alert("‚ö† Please enter a valid scale greater than 0.");
  return;
}
‚úÖ Now you prevent bad requests before they reach the API.

‚úÖ Fix in Backend (Extra Defensive)
In api_check_stock():

python
Copy
Edit
try:
    scale = float(data.get('scale', 1.0))
    if scale <= 0:
        raise ValueError()
except (TypeError, ValueError):
    return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid or missing scale'}), 400
üîÑ Optional: Debug Conversion Failures
Add this in except Exception as e: inside check_recipe_stock():

python
Copy
Edit
logger.error(f"Stock check failed for {ingredient.inventory_item.name}: {str(e)}")
‚úÖ It‚Äôs already there, just make sure it's printing properly.
