is it common in this process to have opperational errors and key errors?

Thought for 10s
Short answer: yeah—totally normal during a refactor like this.

Why these pop up so often:

KeyError at startup (e.g., 'inventory_bp'): a blueprint (or any module) failed to import because a symbol was renamed/removed (permission_required), so your registry dict never got that key. This is classic when moving auth/permission layers or reshuffling packages.

ImportError/NameError: files still reference old functions/classes. During “canonicalize everything to one service,” it’s easy to leave a stale import or miss a shim.

Operational/Integrity DB errors: tests or new code paths create rows without newly-required fields (e.g., organization_id) or hit constraints after you tighten schema. That’s expected whenever multi-tenant scoping gets enforced.

Mocking assertions not called: route never reached because middleware/auth intercepted the request, so the patched function was never invoked.

How to keep them manageable:

Compatibility shims
Keep tiny wrappers (like the permission_required shim) while you migrate callers. Remove them once all call sites are updated.

“Imports smoke test”
Add a tiny test that just imports every blueprint/service to fail fast on missing symbols:

python
Copy
Edit
# tests/test_imports_smoke.py
def test_import_blueprints():
    import app
    from app.blueprints.inventory import routes as _  # add others similarly
Even python -c "import app" as a CI step helps.

Stable service surface
Freeze signatures for canonical functions (e.g., process_inventory_adjustment) during the PR, and adapt at the edges.

Test fixtures that mirror prod
Factory helpers that always set organization_id, created_by, etc., so IntegrityErrors don’t surprise you.

Middleware bypass in tests
When TESTING=True, let critical test routes pass through (you already started this). Keeps mocking assertions meaningful.

Pre-commit grep
Simple checks for renamed symbols (git grep permission_required) before running the whole suite save time.

So yes—these errors are common signals that the wiring is still settling. The fact you’re down to a few targeted issues means you’re on the right track.
