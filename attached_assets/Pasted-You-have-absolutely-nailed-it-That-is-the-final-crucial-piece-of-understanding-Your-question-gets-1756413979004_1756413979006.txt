You have absolutely nailed it. That is the final, crucial piece of understanding. Your question gets to the heart of the client-server relationship in this protocol.
Let me break down the flow with extreme clarity. You are 99% of the way there, and this last 1% is the key.
The service does NOT call the API point.
This is a critical distinction. A backend service cannot "call" a backend API route in the way a browser can. Instead, the service constructs a special set of instructions and sends them back to the browser. It is the browser's job (specifically, your DrawerProtocol.js) to read those instructions and then make a new call to the Drawer Actions API.
This two-step process is what makes the system decoupled and robust.
The Definitive, Step-by-Step Flow
Here is the entire journey of a single "Wall of Drawers" event, from user click to resolution.
THE SCENE: The user is on the "Plan Production" page. They click the "Check Stock" button.
Step 1: The Initial Request (Browser -> Backend)
The stock-check.js file makes an API call to your backend.
POST /api/stock-check with the recipe ID.
Step 2: The Service Chain (Backend)
The stock-check route is triggered. It calls the StockCheckService.
The StockCheckService needs to convert units, so it calls the ConversionEngine service.
Step 3: The Internal Error (Backend)
The ConversionEngine tries to convert floz to lbs but finds the ingredient is missing a density value.
It does NOT crash. It returns a structured error object to the StockCheckService:
code
JSON
{ "success": false, "error": "MISSING_DENSITY", "ingredient_id": 7 }
Step 4: The Drawer Decision (Backend)
The StockCheckService receives this error. It doesn't know what to do with it, so it passes it to the specialist: the conversion service's drawer_errors.py module.
The drawer_errors.py logic recognizes this specific error and says, "Aha! This is a user-fixable problem. I will create a set of instructions for the browser."
It transforms the simple error into a "Drawer Request" object:
code
JSON
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "MISSING_DENSITY",
  "requires_drawer": true,
  "drawer_type": "conversion.density_fix",
  "drawer_data": { "ingredient_id": 7 }
}
Step 5: The Response to the Browser (Backend -> Browser)
The StockCheckService takes this "Drawer Request" object and sends it back as the final response to the original POST /api/stock-check request. The first API call is now complete.
Step 6: The Browser Interprets the Instructions (Browser)
Your DrawerProtocol.js receives the response.
It sees success: false, but it doesn't just show an alert. It specifically checks: if (response.requires_drawer === true).
It sees the flag is true. It now knows its job is to open a drawer.
Step 7: The SECOND Request (Browser -> Backend)
DrawerProtocol.js uses the instructions from the previous response to make a new, second API call to the central hub.
It constructs the URL: GET /api/drawer-actions/conversion/density-fix-modal/7
It sends this request to your drawer_actions blueprint.
Step 8: The Drawer is Served (Backend -> Browser)
The drawer_actions blueprint receives this request. Its only job is to render the density_fix_modal.html template with the ingredient data and send the HTML back to the browser.
Step 9: The User Fixes the Problem (Browser)
DrawerProtocol.js receives the modal HTML, injects it into the page, and shows it.
The user enters the missing density and clicks "Save." The modal saves the data and then fires a custom browser event, like densityUpdated.
Step 10: The Retry (Browser)
DrawerProtocol.js is listening for that densityUpdated event.
When it hears it, it executes the retryCallback function it saved way back in Step 1.
This automatically re-runs the original POST /api/stock-check request.
This time, the loop repeats, but when the ConversionEngine runs, the density exists, and the whole process succeeds, returning the stock check data to the user.
Summary: Who Calls What?
The Frontend (stock-check.js) calls The Service API (/api/stock-check).
The Service (StockCheckService) calls The Utility (ConversionEngine).
The Service (StockCheckService) consults The Specialist (conversion/drawer_errors.py).
The Service API (/api/stock-check) responds to The Frontend with a "Drawer Request."
The Frontend (DrawerProtocol.js) calls The Drawer API (/api/drawer-actions/...).
The Drawer API responds to The Frontend with HTML.
