Looking at your current BatchTrack codebase, here's how the Stripe and Whop billing works in the OIDC/OAuth scenario:

Current System vs OIDC Integration
Current Complex Flow:
Manual Signup → User fills out forms with personal info
Stripe/Whop Redirect → Payment processing with metadata stored
Account Creation → Complete signup after payment success
Complex Metadata Handling → Store signup data in Stripe customer metadata
With OIDC Integration:
OAuth Login → User authenticates with Google/provider (gets email, name automatically)
Simple Payment → Direct to Stripe/Whop with just the authenticated user data
Account Linking → Link payment to existing OAuth identity
Streamlined Flow → No complex metadata juggling
How Your Current Stripe Integration Would Work with OIDC
Instead of this complex flow:

# Current: Store all signup data in Stripe metadata
signup_metadata = {
    'org_name': org_name,
    'username': username, 
    'email': email,
    'first_name': first_name,
    'last_name': last_name,
    'phone': phone or '',
    'password_hash': generate_password_hash(password)  # Security risk!
}
You'd have this simple flow:

# OIDC: User already authenticated, just need payment
metadata = {
    'user_id': current_user.id,  # From OAuth
    'email': current_user.email,  # From OAuth
    'tier': selected_tier
}
Whop Integration with OIDC
Your current Whop service ([whop_service.py]) would become much simpler:

Current: Whop validates license → creates user account
With OIDC: User already exists → Whop just validates subscription access

Key Benefits for BatchTrack
Security: No password storage in Stripe metadata
Simplicity: stripe_service.py becomes 50% smaller
User Experience: "Sign in with Google" → Select plan → Pay → Done
Maintenance: Less complex signup completion logic in billing/routes.py
The Flow Would Be:
Google/OAuth Login → User Profile Created → Select Subscription → 
Stripe/Whop Payment → Subscription Activated → Dashboard Access
Instead of your current:

Manual Form → Validation → Store in Session → Stripe Payment → 
Retrieve Session Data → Create User → Create Organization → Assign Role
Your existing Stripe and Whop services would still work exactly the same - they'd just receive cleaner, simpler data and wouldn't need to handle user account creation since that's handled by the OAuth provider.
