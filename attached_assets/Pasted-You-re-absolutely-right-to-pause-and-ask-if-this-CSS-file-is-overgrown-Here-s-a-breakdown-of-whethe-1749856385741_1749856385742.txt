You're absolutely right to pause and ask if this CSS file is overgrown. Here's a breakdown of whether it's too much, what might be redundant, and what makes it solid.

✅ The Good News
This is actually a well-organized, scalable stylesheet. You’re not bloated — you’re prepared.

✅ Uses CSS custom properties (--space-3, --radius-2, etc.) = excellent for maintainability

✅ Very little hardcoded spacing = clean theme control

✅ Good structure: grouped logically (cards, tables, forms, toggles, etc.)

✅ Fully production-ready for internal apps (like BatchTrack)

⚠️ Minor Redundancies or Considerations
Here’s what you might want to trim or refactor (but only if you’re trying to slim it down or modularize):

🔁 Duplicate .card classes
css
Copy
Edit
.card {
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: var(--radius-3);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-1);
  padding: var(--space-6);
  margin-bottom: var(--space-8);
  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
}
...is repeated near the bottom with just a slightly different margin-bottom.

→ Solution: Keep just one .card rule, and if needed, apply extra spacing via .mb-5 class or similar utility.

🧱 Multiple container classes
css
Copy
Edit
.container {
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 0 var(--space-5);
}
...and also...

css
Copy
Edit
.container {
    margin-top: var(--space-5);
}
→ These are merged poorly and could override each other.
Recommendation: Collapse into one container rule:

css
Copy
Edit
.container {
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: var(--space-5) auto 0 auto;
    padding: 0 var(--space-5);
}
🧱 Repeating .form-group and .alert spacing rules
You have:

css
Copy
Edit
.form-group {
    margin-bottom: var(--space-4);
}
and again later:

css
Copy
Edit
.form-group {
    margin-bottom: var(--space-3);
}
→ Pick one and stick with it unless you’re overriding intentionally.

🧠 How to Keep it Modular Moving Forward
Here’s a suggestion if you're worried this will get messy as your app grows:

🧩 Break into Sections (optional, for big projects):
base.css → spacing, colors, radius variables

components.css → card, button, form styles

layout.css → container, navbar, header layout

modules.css → custom sections like .stock-results, .tile, .batch-status

But for BatchTrack right now: keep it as one file, clean it up just a little, and you're in excellent shape.

✨ TL;DR – Final Take
Concern	Answer
Is this bloated?	❌ No — it’s a solid production CSS
Is anything broken?	❌ Not really — just a few mild overrides or duplicates
Can I keep using this?	✅ Absolutely. You’ve done great work here.
Should I slim it down?	Only if you’re feeling performance-conscious or want modularity later
