I'm trying to get all of this lined out so there's no crazy environment resets if I have to update something, but when are the Cedars actually supposed to run? Is this something that I'm only going to use once when I initialize the ready production version of this and launch it for good question I was kind of viewing this as every .... like that I would rerun these Cedars

This is a critical question for running SaaS apps cleanly, and you’re right to pause here. Let’s break it down so you have a mental model of exactly when seeders should run and how to avoid the “crazy environment reset” problem.

✅ What Seeders Are For
Seeders are one-time or occasional scripts meant to populate default or reference data (not user data). For example:

✅ Run Once:

Permissions list (e.g., inventory.view, batches.finish)

System roles (org_owner, system_admin)

Default subscription tiers (exempt, starter, etc.)

✅ Rarely Rerun (only when updating system-wide defaults):

Adding new permissions or tiers in an app update.

❌ Never Rerun for Runtime Data:

You do not reseed things like user accounts, orgs, or subscription assignments repeatedly—those are live DB records.

✅ When Should Seeders Run?
1. First Production Launch (One-Time)
✔ Run all seeders to initialize the baseline:

Permissions

Roles

Tiers

(Optional) a default dev account

This is usually done right after you run your database migrations.

2. After Future App Updates
✔ Only run delta seeders that insert or update new defaults.
For example:

Adding a new permission (products.bulk_import)

Adding a new tier (enterprise)

The seeder should be idempotent:

Check if the permission/tier already exists (if not exists, insert).

Update only what’s necessary (don’t wipe or reassign everything).

3. Never Automatically on Every Deploy
❌ Why not?

Running full seeders repeatedly can overwrite production data or conflict with live orgs.

Example: you reseed roles and accidentally reset custom tier assignments for paid customers.

✅ Best Practice Flow
Startup Logic for Production
Migrations always run first.

Seeders run conditionally:

Only if table is empty (initial launch).

Or if you explicitly trigger them for a new release.

Development Environment
You can rerun full seeders freely because dev/test DBs are disposable.

Typical Real-World Setup
alembic upgrade head → runs migrations

python seed.py --mode=init → runs initial seeders (only on empty tables)

python seed.py --mode=update → applies only new permissions/tiers

✅ So, For YOU Specifically
How Your Current System Behaves
Right now your seeders re-run on every startup, which is why you keep seeing:

rust
Copy
Edit
✅ Created organization: Jacob Boulette's Organization (ID: 1)
⚠️ Developer role not found - creating basic fallback
This is fine in dev, but dangerous in production because:

It might recreate default orgs if you ever wiped your DB.

It might override updated tier settings.

✅ What You Should Change Before Launch
Split your seeders into two groups:

core_seeders – runs only once (permissions, roles, exempt tier).

update_seeders – runs manually when you release new features.

Wrap with “idempotent” checks:

python
Copy
Edit
if not Permission.query.filter_by(name="inventory.view").first():
    db.session.add(Permission(name="inventory.view"))
Trigger manually on Render after initial launch:

Either via a CLI command or an admin panel action.
