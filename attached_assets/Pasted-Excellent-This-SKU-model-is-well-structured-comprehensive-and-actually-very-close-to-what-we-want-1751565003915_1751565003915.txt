Excellent. This SKU model is well-structured, comprehensive, and actually very close to what we want — it's not the model that’s bloated, it’s the duplicate inventory handling code around it.

✅ Confirmed: What to Keep
These models are not the problem:

✅ ProductSKU
Serves as your sellable unit of inventory

Anchors product name + variant + size

Contains full tracking fields (cost, quantity, tags, eCommerce, quality, location)

✅ ProductSKUHistory
Mirrors raw InventoryHistory correctly

FIFO-compatible

Already supports batch linkage, FIFO references, sale tracking, returns, and reservations

This structure is perfectly reusable as the product-side view of inventory.

🧨 What to Delete
❌ Service Layer to Remove:
ProductInventoryService — every function it performs can be done through your centralized raw adjust_inventory, deduct_fifo, and recount_inventory logic, using item_type='sku'.

❌ Route/UI Layer to Remove:
Product-specific inventory routes like:

/product-inventory/add

/product-inventory/deduct

/product-inventory/spoil, /trash, etc.

JavaScript modals/forms tied to SKU inventory actions (spoil, trash, recount)

Any separate product inventory action card UI component

✅ What to Rewire
Once you delete ProductInventoryService, you’ll want to wire all SKU inventory interactions through your centralized raw inventory system.

This means:

Adding SKU-level support in:

adjust_inventory(item_id=sku.id, item_type='sku')

deduct_fifo(item_id=sku.id, item_type='sku')

recount_inventory(...)

Using the existing ProductSKUHistory table with those actions, just like InventoryHistory

Ensuring ProductSKU.current_quantity stays in sync with sum(ProductSKUHistory.remaining_quantity) via a validation function like:

python
Copy
Edit
ProductSKU.query.get(sku_id).current_quantity == sum(entry.remaining_quantity for entry in ProductSKUHistory.query.filter_by(sku_id=sku_id))
🧱 Final System Design Summary
Layer	Responsibility	Source of Truth
ProductSKU	Sellable unit (parent + variant + size)	✅
ProductSKUHistory	FIFO log of all activity	✅
Raw inventory system	Handles all inventory actions (via item_type='sku')	✅
adjust_inventory()	Adds stock, updates FIFO	✅
deduct_fifo()	Deducts stock using FIFO entries	✅
recount_inventory()	Recounts SKU quantity	✅

🛠 Next Steps
✅ Delete ProductInventoryService.py

✅ Remove product inventory action routes + templates

✅ Add support for item_type='sku' in your existing inventory routes and forms

✅ Make SKU detail page use ProductSKUHistory only for display

✅ Confirm FIFO history creation uses fifo_reference_id, fifo_source, and remaining_quantity properly

Let me know if you'd like a checklist or code updates to:

Extend adjust_inventory to handle SKU cleanly

Rebuild a lighter product SKU dashboard that pulls from existing logic

Validate SKU inventory via background job or admin tool

You're on the right path. The raw inventory system should be the engine — and this SKU model is its passenger, not a second driver. 💥

please look at the models. Thre are several redundant tables. 

quty change. old qty. new qty. remaining. original. 

there should only be the master invnetory number. I think 'current quantity' and the change amount from the action. 

history needs fifo original qty. and remaining qty. 

change should be in history and be used for the adjustment service to give to fifo and adjustment rout to change current ivnetory. 

right?

Yes — you're absolutely correct, and your instinct is grounded in proper data modeling principles. Let’s walk through it clearly:

✅ Core Principle
“There should be one source of truth for inventory. History is a ledger, not a calculator.”

That means:

✅ ProductSKU.current_quantity = the master field

✅ History logs how that number changed, not duplicate snapshots of the total

🔍 What You Have Now (Too Much Redundancy)
In ProductSKUHistory you currently store:

Field	Problem
quantity_change	✅ Required — this is what actually happened
old_quantity	❌ Redundant — can be derived from prior sum
new_quantity	❌ Redundant — also derived from ledger state
original_quantity	✅ Required only for additions — needed for FIFO starting value
remaining_quantity	✅ Required — for FIFO tracking on that original quantity
current_quantity (in SKU)	✅ Master field — always up-to-date

✅ What to Keep
Table	Field	Keep?	Reason
ProductSKU	current_quantity	✅	Single source of truth
ProductSKUHistory	quantity_change	✅	Represents the delta
ProductSKUHistory	original_quantity	✅	Needed for FIFO (only for adds)
ProductSKUHistory	remaining_quantity	✅	FIFO tracking (deducts pull from here)

Everything else (old_quantity, new_quantity) can go.

📦 Example Simplified History Logic
python
Copy
Edit
history = ProductSKUHistory(
    sku_id=sku.id,
    change_type='restock',
    quantity_change=+50,
    original_quantity=50,
    remaining_quantity=50,
    unit_cost=2.50,
    notes='Restocked from Supplier X'
)
sku.current_quantity += 50
A deduction:

python
Copy
Edit
deduction = ProductSKUHistory(
    sku_id=sku.id,
    change_type='sale',
    quantity_change=-10,
    fifo_reference_id=source_entry.id,
    remaining_quantity=0,  # Deductions have no remaining
    unit_cost=source_entry.unit_cost,
    notes='Sold via POS'
)
source_entry.remaining_quantity -= 10
sku.current_quantity -= 10
🧠 Summary of Correct Architecture
ProductSKU (Master)
current_quantity ✅

ProductSKUHistory (FIFO Ledger)
quantity_change ✅

original_quantity ✅ (for additions only)

remaining_quantity ✅ (for FIFO management)

fifo_reference_id ✅ (for deductions)

unit_cost, change_type, etc. ✅

🧹 Clean-Up Steps
❌ Remove old_quantity and new_quantity

✅ Keep original_quantity only for change_type in ['restock', 'batch_addition', 'manual_add']

✅ Ensure adjust_inventory() and deduct_fifo() use:

current_quantity from SKU

remaining_quantity in FIFO

✅ Add a sync validation like:

python
Copy
Edit
assert sku.current_quantity == sum(h.remaining_quantity for h in ProductSKUHistory.query.filter_by(sku
