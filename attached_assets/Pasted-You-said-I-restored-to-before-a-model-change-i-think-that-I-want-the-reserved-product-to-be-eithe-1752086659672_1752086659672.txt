I restored to before a model change 

i think that I want the reserved product to be either a tag or a item type. are there enough properties in  a reserved item to justify its own inventroy item type? 

componded? item type product-reserved? 

it seems like it would be easier to disrelate the inventroy than to solve the fifo and recount issues that exist if they are the same

You're right to be thinking this through carefully — this is one of those architecture-level decisions that either creates clarity or multiplies edge cases forever.

Let’s answer your question directly and then give a strong recommendation.

🧠 Your Question
Are there enough properties in a reserved product to justify its own inventory item type?

✅ Yes — if you want clean separation, then yes, reservations should be their own inventory type.
Here’s why:

✅ Why a Separate Inventory Type for Reserved Makes Sense
Reason	Explanation
Different semantics	Reserved items aren’t physically available for production or sale — they are logically allocated.
Different lifecycle	Reserved items don’t participate in normal FIFO deductions until converted to a sale.
Different adjustment flows	Reserved items must reference order_id, while regular items don’t.
Different recount rules	Reserved stock is not counted in standard physical recounts unless reviewing specific orders.
No spoilage	Reserved stock doesn’t expire the same way unless tied to a physical perishable claim.
No dual-ownership logic	Keeping reserved and available under the same inventory item means recounts, spoilage, and deductions always have to split logic by change_type — messy and error-prone.

🧾 Clean Design: Split the Inventory Item
Instead of doing this:

python
Copy
Edit
InventoryItem:
  id: 1
  type: 'product'
  quantity: 30  ← includes both reserved and available
Do this:

python
Copy
Edit
InventoryItem(id=101)
  type: 'product'
  name: 'Royal Tallow 4oz'
  quantity: 25

InventoryItem(id=102)
  type: 'product-reserved'
  name: 'Royal Tallow 4oz (Reserved)'
  quantity: 5
Both map back to the same SKU

Reserved inventory is always logged in its own FIFO stream

Recounts, reservations, and releases only touch one or the other

You can even visually group them under one product in the UI

📦 What This Enables
✅ Simpler Recount
Recount of available inventory doesn’t even look at reserved

✅ Accurate FIFO
FIFO always deducts from the product type, not product-reserved

✅ Better Shopify Sync
Shopify reads available stock from product, not product-reserved

Order fulfillment converts product-reserved → product deduction FIFO

🔧 How to Implement This Cleanly
Change	What to Do
✅ InventoryItem.type	Add new enum: 'product-reserved'
✅ FIFOService	Treat product-reserved entries as their own stream
✅ Reservation logic	On reservation, create FIFO entry against product-reserved inventory item ID
✅ SKU Display	In UI, group product and product-reserved as children of the same SKU
✅ Recount logic	Only operate on inventory items with type product unless user enters reservation release mode
✅ BatchTrace	ProductSKU → links to both items; InventoryItem carries type
✅ Order fulfillment	Deduct from reserved FIFO (via reservation ID) or fallback to available FIFO if released

🧠 Naming Pattern Options
Option	Example
Item Type	product, product-reserved
Tag (supplementary)	reserved tag on InventoryItem or SKU
Display	Name stays the same; grouped in UI under “Reserved Inventory” section

🧭 Final Recommendation
✅ Yes — split into a separate InventoryItem with type product-reserved

It will:

Massively simplify your FIFO and recount logic

Let you track reservations per order without breaking physical on-hand logic

Make the system future-proof for preorders, hold requests, and large wholesale workflows

Match how major platforms (e.g., Shopify + NetSuite) model inventory segmentation

Let me know if you'd like:

A one-click migration plan to split reserved inventory from existing InventoryItems

A UI/UX grouping mockup of Available vs Reserved stock under one SKU

An auto-promotion trigger: "Convert reserved to available" (i.e. if reservation expires or order is canceled)

This is the cleanest path forward for both product growth and user sanity.
