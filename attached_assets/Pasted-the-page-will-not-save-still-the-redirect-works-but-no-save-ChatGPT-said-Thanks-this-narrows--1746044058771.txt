the page will not save still. the redirect works, but no save

Thanks — this narrows it down: the redirect works, but the form data isn't saving. That strongly suggests one of the following:

🔍 Diagnosis Checklist
Missing form fields: Are you sure fields like notes, tags, etc. are actually present and named correctly in the HTML?

Empty or incorrect name attributes: Flask uses request.form.get("...") which depends on those name attributes being present and correct.

Unsubmitted values: Are the fields filled out before hitting “Save and Exit”?

CSRF issues: CSRF token might be invalid or ignored in the form handler.

Session rollback: An error might be occurring silently and rolling back the DB save.

✅ Let's Start by Checking What's Actually in the Form
I'll scan the rest of batch_in_progress.html to confirm whether it includes fields for:

notes

tags

extra_ingredients[], extra_amounts[], extra_units[]

extra_containers[], extra_container_amounts[]

If those are missing, the backend logic won’t have anything to save. Let me check.

✅ All the expected form fields (notes, tags, extra_ingredients[], etc.) are present in the template.

That tells us the issue is likely in the backend logic — possibly due to:

The save block in finish_batch not updating more than just notes and tags.

extra_* fields being read but not written anywhere in the database.

🔍 Next Diagnostic Step
I'll now analyze the full finish_batch function to verify:

Whether the extra_* fields are processed and saved properly.

If db.session.add() is used for any new/updated models before db.session.commit().

Let's inspect the rest of the function logic. ​​

Here's the issue:

🚨 Critical Gap in the finish_batch Route
The route reads these lists:

python
Copy
Edit
extra_ingredients = request.form.getlist('extra_ingredients[]')
extra_amounts = request.form.getlist('extra_amounts[]')
extra_units = request.form.getlist('extra_units[]')

extra_containers = request.form.getlist('extra_containers[]')
extra_container_amounts = request.form.getlist('extra_container_amounts[]')
But then... does nothing with them! ❌ No database objects are created or updated based on that input.

✅ How to Fix It
To actually save these inputs, you'll need to:

Loop over the input lists

Create models (e.g., ExtraIngredient, Container)

Link them to the batch

Add them to the session before db.session.commit()

Example Fix (inside if action == "save" block):
python
Copy
Edit
# Save extra ingredients
for name, amount, unit in zip(extra_ingredients, extra_amounts, extra_units):
    if name.strip():
        ingredient = ExtraIngredient(
            batch_id=batch.id,
            name=name,
            amount=float(amount or 0),
            unit=unit
        )
        db.session.add(ingredient)

# Save extra containers
for container, qty in zip(extra_containers, extra_container_amounts):
    if container.strip():
        container_model = BatchContainer(
            batch_id=batch.id,
            name=container,
            quantity=float(qty or 0)
        )
        db.session.add(container_model)
