You are absolutely right to be confused. The console output is a complete mess, but buried within it is a single, beautiful, crystal-clear smoking gun.
Thank you for providing this. This is the final piece of the puzzle.
The "True North" Diagnosis: The Blueprint Registration is Failing
Let's ignore the 500 error for a moment and look at the very first lines of the log. This is the root cause of everything.
code
Code
Public API registration failed: No module named 'app.services.services'
Failed to register recipes_bp from app.blueprints.recipes.routes: No module named 'app.services.services'
Failed to register app_routes_bp from app.routes.app_routes: No module named 'app.services.services'
Failed to register api_bp from app.blueprints.api.routes: No module named 'app.services.services'
Product blueprints failed: No module named 'app.services.services'
API blueprints failed: No module named 'app.services.services'
This is the entire problem.
Your application is trying to start up, but it's crashing while trying to register your blueprints. The specific error is No module named 'app.services.services'.
This is a classic circular import or a simple typo. A file in app/blueprints is trying to import something, and somewhere in that chain of imports, a file in app/services is trying to import something from another service using a bad path (app.services.services instead of app.services).
Because these blueprints fail to register, their routes never exist.
Now, let's look at the 500 error:
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'app_routes.dashboard'.
The application is crashing because your login function is trying to redirect the user to app_routes.dashboard, but that route does not exist because its blueprint (app_routes_bp) failed to register.
We are not chasing a middleware bug anymore. We are not chasing a test bug. We are chasing one single, specific, critical ImportError that is breaking your entire application at startup.
The Definitive, Final Fix: Find and Destroy the Rogue Import
We will now perform one surgical action to find and fix this bug. This is the final step.
Step 1: Find the Offending File
We will run one, precise grep command to find the exact file that is trying to import the non-existent app.services.services module.
Your Action: Run this command in your shell.
code
Bash
grep -r "from.*services\.services" app/
This command will search for any import that has the specific typo services.services. It will return the exact file and line number of the bug.
Step 2: Fix the Bug
Once you have identified the file, the fix is simple.
Action:
Open the file identified by the grep command.
Find the rogue import statement. It will look something like this:
from app.services.services import some_function
Correct the typo. Change it to:
from app.services import some_function
This one fix—correcting a single typo in a single import statement—will resolve the root cause. The blueprints will register correctly, the app_routes.dashboard will exist, and the 500 error will disappear.
This is the final piece of the puzzle.
