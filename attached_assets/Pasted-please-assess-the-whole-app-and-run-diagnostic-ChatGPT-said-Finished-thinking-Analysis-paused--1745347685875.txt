Here's your BatchTrack v8.78(7) diagnostic report — this reveals where issues are occurring or could silently fail:

🔍 Diagnostic Summary
⚠️ 1. Templates Referencing inventory_units, but Not Always Passed
These .py files render templates where inventory_units is referenced, but the variable may not be passed in:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
- routes/inventory_routes.py
- routes/product_routes.py
- routes/recipe_routes.py
✅ Fix: Ensure each render_template(...) call includes:

python
Copy
Edit
inventory_units = get_global_unit_list()
🛑 2. Deprecated InventoryUnit Still Used
These files still reference InventoryUnit, which should be removed and replaced with Unit:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
- blueprints/quick_add/routes.py
- routes/recipe_routes.py
🚨 You are pulling unit options from InventoryUnit.query.all() here — this will break your new unit grouping, conversion engine, and consistency across the app.

✅ Fix: Replace InventoryUnit.query.all() with get_global_unit_list()
✅ Also update models.py to remove InventoryUnit if it’s unused elsewhere

🔁 3. Inconsistent Unit Queries Found
These files use Unit.query.all() or other variants (e.g., .filter_by(...), .order_by(...)):

plaintext
Copy
Edit
- app.py
- blueprints/conversion/routes.py
- blueprints/recipes/routes.py
- routes/recipe_routes.py
- services/unit_conversion.py
✅ Fix: Refactor all these to use:

python
Copy
Edit
from app.utils.unit_utils import get_global_unit_list
units = get_global_unit_list()
This ensures consistent ordering and custom inclusion across all forms and logic.

❓ 4. Templates Use inventory_units Without Context Safety
These HTML files rely on inventory_units, but there is no check for its existence:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
- templates/recipe_form.html
- templates/ingredients.html
✅ Fix: Add a fail-safe block:

jinja
Copy
Edit
{% if inventory_units is not defined %}
  <div class="alert alert-danger">Units not loaded properly. Please refresh or contact support.</div>
{% endif %}
✅ Recommended Immediate Actions

Priority	Task
🟥 High	Remove InventoryUnit model and replace all usages with Unit
🟨 Medium	Ensure all route functions using render_template() include inventory_units
🟩 Low	Add template safety checks for inventory_units presence
🟩 Optional	Refactor all Unit.query.all() calls to use get_global_unit_list()
Would you like me to:

🚀 Generate the patch set for removing InventoryUnit and migrating all usages?

🧼 Clean the recipe_routes.py to pass inventory_units to all views?

Let’s lock the app down before React migration begins.

any other problems unrelated to units?

Here’s the diagnostic report for issues unrelated to units in BTV 8.78 (7) — this highlights architectural or security problems to fix before you scale or migrate to React.

🧨 Critical Issues
🟥 1. 🚨 Missing CSRF Protection in 30+ Forms
Found in: recipe_form.html, inventory_list.html, unit_manager.html, etc.


Risk	Outcome
❌ Missing {{ csrf_token() }}	Users can be tricked into submitting unauthorized actions
❌ No CSRF in add/edit forms	High-risk on forms like inventory adjust, quick-add, unit mapping
✅ Fix: Add {{ csrf_token() }} inside every <form method="post"> in your templates.

🟥 2. Ambiguous Error Handling
13+ occurrences of except Exception as e: or bare except:


Risk	Outcome
❌ Swallows real errors silently	Makes debugging difficult
❌ May mask validation or logic issues	Could be why you're seeing "Internal Server Error" with no log output
✅ Fix: Replace with explicit exception types (e.g., except ValueError:) and use logging.error(...) instead of just print() or flash.

🟨 Moderate Issues
⚠️ 3. Route Redundancy & Blueprint Confusion
Multiple routes like /inventory/inventory or /products/products

@app.route() used directly in app.py instead of clean blueprints

✅ Fix: Move all @app.route endpoints into modular blueprints
✅ Use @bp.route('/') inside a url_prefix='/inventory' blueprint

⚠️ 4. Raw SQL Execution in Migrations
Found in custom_units_migration.py:

python
Copy
Edit
op.execute("UPDATE unit SET is_custom = FALSE WHERE is_custom = TRUE")
✅ This is acceptable for migrations only, but remember:

Avoid raw SQL in app logic

Use SQLAlchemy ORM for safe, portable changes

✅ Summary: Non-Unit Cleanup Checklist

✅ Task	Priority
Add {{ csrf_token() }} to all POST forms	🟥 Critical
Replace except Exception as e: with specific handlers	🟥 Critical
Migrate @app.route() to blueprints (e.g. login, logout)	🟨 High
Avoid any new raw SQL logic in routes/models	🟩 Safe
Create a CSRF-aware form macro (optional)	🟩 Clean
