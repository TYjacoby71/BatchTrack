Here’s a structured prompt you can use to define and build out the Product Inventory Path after Finish Batch, especially for integrating with container logic, Shopify sync, and FIFO tracking:

🔧 Prompt: Finish Batch → Product Inventory Logic & UI
1. 🧭 Product Type Path Decision (after batch completion)
✅ If Batch Output Type = "product", continue to product inventory logic

❌ If "intermediate", skip this flow entirely (handled via ingredient stock logic)

2. 📦 Product Selection (from Finish Batch Modal)
Required: Select Product (Parent)

Required: Select Variant (e.g. scent, type, color)

Quick Add:
Allow quick-add modal for creating:

New Product Parent

New Variant (auto-bond to parent)

3. 🧴 Container-Based Yield Mapping
✅ If Containers Were Selected During Start Batch:
Each container instance (e.g. “4 oz jar”) becomes a size variant

Quantities (2x 4 oz, 1x 8 oz) are logged as:

Product Parent: e.g. Royal Tallow

Variant: Lavender

Size: 4 oz, 8 oz → auto-generated as sub-variant or size field

❌ If No Containers Used:
Yield is passed directly based on unit type selected in recipe (e.g., grams, mL, oz)

These become the sellable unit for the product

Used for Shopify sync and price/unit logic

4. 📊 Product Inventory Page Structure
Should mirror Inventory Page for raw ingredients:

Header Fields:
Product Name (parent)

Variant (scent/type)

Container Size (or Unit of Measure)

Current Stock

AWC (Average Weighted Cost)

Expiration Flags (optional)

Details Modal:
Edit product info

Set container equivalencies if not auto-linked

Toggle Shopify Sync On/Off (future feature)

History Table (with FIFO):
Same logic as ingredient FIFO:

Track restocks (via finished batches)

Track deductions (manual spoil/trash/sale)

Show unit cost, quantity, expiration

Link back to batch that created the product
