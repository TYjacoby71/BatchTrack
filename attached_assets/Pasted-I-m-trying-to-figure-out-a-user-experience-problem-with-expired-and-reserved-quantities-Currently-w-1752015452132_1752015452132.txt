I'm trying to figure out a user experience problem with expired and reserved quantities. Currently with expiration, my total quantity stored in inventory item The model is item quantity. That is the master quantity. In the inventory page it shows expired and available and excludes expired from FIFO functions. I'm trying to figure out where reservations need to be. I'm trying to figure out if product quantity which is item quantity with type product should display both available and reserved and be the total or if it should only display the available. And if it is only supposed to display it available I think it would be more prudent for me to reassign the reserved as its own inventory type. It would separate it and allow me to create lots that would be updated easier I think. A lot of back and forth problems. One big code that I don't want to crack into is the recount logic. Recount is tricky enough to operate in and out of FIFO sync and I'm not sure how recount should affect reserved and available. One option would be that the recount form should now include a reservation recount as well. So regular stock and reserved stock would be two inputs needed. For example user needs to recount types in 10 units found and reserved zero. Then it would go after the according reservation lots and zero them out if they had remaining inventory and would go after the other product inventory fi fo lots and refill back to 10. That does seem like the best way and then regular inventory actions such as reserve or release reservation would require an amount and an order number. I think that releasing the reservation would require the order number and only allow the user to either release the full amount or not. Does that work well with Shopify? These are all rules that as I understand Shopify will hook into and actuate is that right?

You're in a high-level inventory architecture zone ‚Äî this is the right thinking for a scalable, Shopify-compatible product system. Let‚Äôs walk through each decision point and provide both conceptual clarity and practical recommendations.

üß† Core Concepts and Problems You're Juggling
Concept	Challenge You're Facing
item.quantity	Should it reflect available only or available + reserved?
Expired Stock	‚úÖ Already excluded from FIFO and shown separately
Reserved Stock	Needs to be shown & tracked ‚Äî but not treated like expired
Recount	Needs to reconcile both available & reserved without breaking FIFO chain
Shopify Compatibility	Shopify expects real-time quantity info to prevent overselling
UX Simplicity	Users need clarity on what they‚Äôre adjusting and why

‚úÖ Your Options, Assessed
‚ùì Should InventoryItem.quantity Include Reserved?
Option	Pros	Cons
Includes reserved (total on-hand)	‚úÖ Matches warehouse behavior
‚úÖ Supports physical reconciliation	‚ùå FIFO calculations now need quantity - reserved_total everywhere
Excludes reserved (only available)	‚úÖ FIFO-ready
‚úÖ Shopify-safe
‚úÖ "True available" for real-time sale	‚ùå Makes it harder to answer "how much total product do I have?" in one field

‚úÖ Verdict:
Keep item.quantity = available stock only (FIFO-eligible).
Store reserved_quantity separately ‚Äî but attached to inventory_item_id with dedicated FIFO change_type='reserved_allocation'.

This matches how Shopify handles it ‚Äî total available is what Shopify displays and deducts from.

üîí Reserved Inventory Design Suggestion
Create FIFO entries with change_type='reserved_allocation' and positive remaining_quantity

Track order_id for each

Treat these as ‚Äúshadow inventory‚Äù that is not deducted from inventory_item.quantity but still tracked per SKU

A new column inventory_reserved_quantity (or a service that sums them) can populate a UI "Reserved" field

üîÑ Recount Implications
Yes ‚Äî your best design is this:

üîß Recount Form Should Include:
Field	Purpose
available_count (e.g. 10)	Replaces current FIFO stock
reserved_count (e.g. 0)	Replaces reserved allocations
order_ids_to_clear	(Optional) Advanced field to expire certain reservations

‚úÖ Why This Works:
Keeps FIFO clean ‚Äî recount always resets the true state of what‚Äôs on-hand

Enables full transparency: ‚ÄúWe have 10 available, 0 reserved‚Äù

Reserved FIFO entries are treated as shadow claims ‚Äî you zero them via recount when needed

üîÑ Reservation Rules (with Shopify in Mind)
Action	Trigger	Required Data	Effect
Reserve	Shopify adds to cart or places order	SKU, quantity, order_id	Create reserved_allocation FIFO entry
Release	Shopify order is canceled or edited	SKU, order_id	Remove/zero matching reserved_allocation entries
Convert to Sale	Shopify order is fulfilled	SKU, order_id	Remove reservation, create sale entry, deduct from FIFO

‚úÖ These actions already align with your system‚Äôs convert_reservation_to_sale(), release_reservation(), and handle_refund_credits() functions.

üîÅ FIFO Recount Flow (Example)
Let‚Äôs say:

You expected: 8 available, 2 reserved

You found: 10 available, 0 reserved

Your recount form input:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Available: 10
Reserved: 0
System actions:

Deduct all remaining quantities from reserved_allocation FIFO entries (change_type='recount')

Increase available stock by adding new FIFO entry (change_type='recount') OR refill previous ones

Recalculate inventory_item.quantity to match 10

‚úÖ Result: you are in FIFO sync, Shopify-safe, and your audit trail is clean.

üí° Recommendation Summary
Feature	Recommendation
InventoryItem.quantity	Only tracks available (not expired or reserved)
Reserved Inventory	Tracked via FIFO entries with change_type='reserved_allocation'
Recount UI	Add two fields: available_quantity, reserved_quantity
FIFO Recount Logic	Separate refill of existing reserved lots vs available lots
Shopify Hooks	Use order_id to tie reservation ‚Üí sale or cancel cleanly
Release Reservation	Require full release (simple), partial later with UI upgrade

‚úÖ You're 95% aligned with Shopify best practices already.
