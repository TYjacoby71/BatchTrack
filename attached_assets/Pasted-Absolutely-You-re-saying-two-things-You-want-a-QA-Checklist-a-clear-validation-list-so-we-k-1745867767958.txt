Absolutely. âœ…
You're saying two things:

You want a QA Checklist â€” a clear validation list â€” so we know if we built this correctly before launch.

You want to combine this container/yield/strict-flex flow with the full stock check system rebuild (universal stock check service we discussed).

âœ… Perfect.
âœ… Logical.
âœ… Necessary for a true production release.

ðŸ“‹ Combined QA Checklist â€” BatchTrack v8+ Strict/Flex Plan Production + Stock Check Revitalization
ðŸŽ¯ Universal Stock Check Revitalization (USCS) Goals

QA Check	Description	Status
1	One global backend service /api/check-stock used by all pages (Start Modal, Plan Production, Bulk Check)	
2	Input must accept: {recipe_id, scale, container plan}	
3	Output must return: [ { type, name, needed, available, status } ] unified list	
4	Ingredients always scaled correctly	
5	Unit conversion handled automatically (UUCS tied in)	
6	Containers must check against selected types and quantities	
7	Returns OK / LOW / NEEDED statuses properly	
8	If batch cannot be contained, returns containment failure error (before stock check)	
9	Allow "Override Anyway" option after failure	
10	Error handling with clear frontend error messages (no silent crashes)	
ðŸ§  Strict/Flex Plan Production Flow QA Goals

QA Check	Description	Status
11	Plan Production Setup page shows Scale selection first	
12	Plan Production Setup asks for container selection after scale	
13	Strict Mode (Auto Fill Containers) toggle ON by default	
14	Strict Mode uses predicted recipe yield to determine container need	
15	Flexible Mode allows freeform container selections	
16	Auto-fill logic prefers largest containers allowed, then smaller containers	
17	Container options filtered by recipe-allowed container types	
18	Vertical progress bar showing containment fill % (oz/ml/count depending on recipe)	
19	Display remaining to contain dynamically ("You still need to contain 12 oz")	
20	Auto-fill adjustable: manual containers can be added if fill is incomplete	
21	If no possible way to contain, static error: "Cannot fully contain batch" + Ziplock override button	
22	In Flexible Mode, still display predicted yield for user awareness	
ðŸ“¦ Container Management QA Goals

QA Check	Description	Status
23	Containers must have: Name, Storage Amount, Storage Unit	
24	Storage Unit drives batch logic (volume-based or count-based)	
25	If container Storage Unit is "count" â†’ treat as multiplier (e.g., bread bag fits 12 loaves)	
26	If container Storage Unit is "oz/ml/g" â†’ treat as storage capacity for product volume/weight	
27	Quick Add Container Modal exists on Recipe Edit Page	
28	Quick Add Container Modal is simple: Name / Storage Amount / Storage Unit only	
ðŸ“œ Recipe Management QA Goals

QA Check	Description	Status
29	Recipes must define Predicted Yield and Unit	
30	Recipe Predicted Yield Unit drives batch type (volume or count)	
31	Container eligibility is set in Recipe Editor (Allowed Containers)	
32	Recipe Quick Add Container modal directly attaches new containers for eligibility	
ðŸ”¥ Batch Finish Page QA Goals (Optional Next Stage)

QA Check	Description	Status
33	User records Actual Yield at Batch Finish	
34	Compare Predicted vs Actual Yield	
35	Offer Adjustment Option: "Update Recipe Predicted Yield"	
36	Offer Clone Option: "Create New Recipe Variation Based on Actual Yield"	
ðŸ§© Summary
âœ… This combined QA list ensures that:

Universal Stock Check becomes one clean, global service.

Strict/Flex Mode is fully user-friendly, accurate, and extendable.

Containers and Recipe Logic are fully normalized and production-ready.

Batch Finish feedback loop is ready for full refinement features (optional).

ðŸ”¥ Bonus: Build Priority Recommendation
If you want fast movement toward MVP polish:


Priority	Item
ðŸ¥‡ Highest	Universal Stock Check Service (USCS)
ðŸ¥ˆ High	Plan Production Setup (Strict/Flex toggle, fill bar, override logic)
ðŸ¥‰ Medium	Recipe Page Quick Add Container Modal
ðŸ¥‰ Medium	Container Inventory System Revamp (Name + Storage Amount + Unit)
ðŸ¥‰ Medium	Batch Finish Predicted vs Actual Yield (optional for launch)
