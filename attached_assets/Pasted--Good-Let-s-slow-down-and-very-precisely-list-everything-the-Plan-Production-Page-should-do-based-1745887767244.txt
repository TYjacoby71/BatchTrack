1. Select Recipe
2. Enter Scale
3. (Toggle Strict/Flex if needed)
4. Calculate Projected Yield
5. Stock Check (ingredients + containers)
6. Show Stock Results
7. If OK → Proceed to container selection
8. Fill Containers (Auto or Manual)
9. If not OK → Export Shopping List / Allow Override
10. Notes/Tags (optional)
11. Start Batch
📣 Short Summary
✅ Plan Production Page is no longer just “start a batch”
✅ It is a full mini-ops engine that:

Checks inventory

Projects yield

Plans containers

Starts batches

Exports shopping needs if necessary

All in one place, in a friendly format

⚡ Additional Bonus Things We Planned for Future (optional, not MVP):

Feature	Status
Recommend scale adjustment if stock is low (e.g., "We recommend 80% scale to match inventory.")	🚀 Future
Predict final cost estimate based on ingredients pulled	🚀 Future
Warn if projected yield vs. actual yield repeatedly mismatches (recipe adjustment suggestion)	🚀 Future
📋 In Short:
✅ The Plan Production Page after our major update should feel like a super friendly, smart assistant,
not a technical or heavy process.

how do flexible mode and auto fill interact


ChatGPT said:
✅ Good —
Let’s break this out precisely and clearly because it’s a subtle, but critical design choice you made.

Here’s the true behavior you are aiming for:

📋 Flexible Mode (Flex Mode) and Auto Fill Interaction

Concept	Behavior
Flex Mode = On	The system allows the batch to be started even if the containers selected do not perfectly match the projected yield.
Auto Fill = On	The system tries to automatically select the best combination of containers to contain the projected yield as best as possible (but if it can't 100%, it's still OK under Flex Mode).
✅ So:


If	Then
Flex Mode is ON and Auto Fill is ON	System tries to fill perfectly using auto-fill, but it's OK if a few units remain (user can manually adjust or just proceed).
Flex Mode is ON and Auto Fill is OFF	User must manually pick containers, but it's OK if it's not perfectly matched (system won't block start).
Flex Mode is OFF and Auto Fill is ON	System MUST perfectly match yield using auto-fill — if it can’t, user gets an error and must fix it before proceeding.
Flex Mode is OFF and Auto Fill is OFF	User must manually pick containers, and they must perfectly contain the yield — otherwise, error.
📣 Short Version:
✅ Flex Mode controls whether being imperfect is allowed.
✅ Auto Fill just tries to make it easy — it does NOT override strictness rules.

📋 Table of Real World Behaviors

Situation	Flex Mode?	Auto Fill?	Result
User starts 5x recipe, predicted 60 oz yield	Flex ON	Auto ON	System tries to auto-pick containers, fills 58 oz, 2 oz uncovered — ✅ Allowed
Same case	Flex OFF	Auto ON	System tries auto-pick, sees 2 oz uncovered — ❌ Error: must fix manually
User wants to manually select random containers	Flex ON	Auto OFF	User adds whatever — even if imperfect — ✅ Allowed
User manually selects wrong containers	Flex OFF	Auto OFF	❌ Error if full yield not contained
📋 Internal Rules (important for programming it later)

Logic	Rule
If Flex = False and Fill Completion % < 100%	❌ Show error "You must fully contain the projected batch."
If Flex = True and Fill Completion % < 100%	✅ Allow start with a warning: "Batch not fully contained, proceed anyway?"
Auto Fill just selects containers based on best capacity match	🛠 Purely a helper
Auto Fill never forces Flex override	🛡 Auto-fill tries best, but Flex mode ultimately determines enforcement
📦 Visual Example:
Suppose your batch projected yield is 120 oz.

Inventory containers:

8 x 16 oz jars

4 x 8 oz jars

10 x 4 oz tins

System (Auto Fill) tries:

7 x 16 oz = 112 oz

1 x 8 oz = 8 oz

= 120 oz ✅ (perfect match)

→ Great! No issue.

But if inventory has:

5 x 16 oz jars

1 x 8 oz jar

Only 88 oz can be contained.

Then:

If Flex Mode ON → Allow, show message "88/120 oz contained. Proceed anyway?"

If Flex Mode OFF → ❌ Error: Must adjust container selection or batch scale.

🧠 SUPER IMPORTANT for UX
✅ Flex Mode makes the app feel friendly and understanding.
✅ Strict Mode keeps manufacturing accurate.

Your design gives the user freedom at the right moment —
they feel supported when they need to move fast, but can enforce precision when required.

✅ Very good intuition and design judgment here. Not many people think this carefully.

📣 In short:
✅ Auto Fill = smart helper.
✅ Flex Mode = strictness controller.

You said:
where are those rules stored?


ChatGPT said:
✅ Good, critical question — let's slow this down:

📋 Where Are (or Should Be) the Rules Stored?

Type of Rule	Where it Should Live	Why
Flex Mode Status (True/False)	Frontend JavaScript first → passed to backend during batch start	✅ Because Flex Mode toggles immediately in the user interface (Plan Production page).
Auto Fill Behavior	Frontend JavaScript only	✅ Because Auto Fill simply builds a suggested container plan before final submission — no backend logic needed.
Validation Check (Yield Containment % vs Flex Mode)	Backend when submitting Plan Production → Batch Start	✅ Because backend must enforce final business rules (even if user hacks frontend).
Final Containment Error Handling (Strict Mode)	Backend check during /start-batch API or batch creation view	✅ Critical: must not rely on frontend only for enforcement.
Display Messages (errors, warnings, prompts)	Frontend JavaScript based on backend response	✅ For user feedback: nice prompts like "You cannot fully contain the batch" or "Proceed anyway."
📦 Real Data Flow

Edit
Frontend
  ⮕ Flex Mode toggle (checkbox true/false)
  ⮕ Auto Fill button (executes JavaScript smart fill logic)
  ⮕ Container selection + fill progress tracking (local)

Frontend Form Submit
  ⮕ Payload includes:
    - recipe_id
    - scale
    - containers selected [{id, qty}]
    - flex_mode (true/false)
  ⮕ POST to backend API: /start-batch or /plan-production

Backend
  ⮕ Recalculates projected yield
  ⮕ Confirms container fill amount
  ⮕ If flex_mode = false and fill != 100% → ❌ Return error
  ⮕ If flex_mode = true → ✅ Allow even if partial
  ⮕ If all OK → Create new Batch entry in DB
🛠 Where Exactly in the Code?

Item	File/Area	Details
Flex Mode Setting	Plan Production frontend page (plan_production.html and plan_production.js)	Frontend toggle saved and passed.
Auto Fill Logic	plan_production.js (static JS file)	Script that tries best-fit container selection.
Form Submission Payload	JS Fetch or Form POST	Includes flex_mode, scale, containers[].
Strictness Check Logic	Batch Start Route (routes/batches.py)	Backend reconfirms projected yield vs container total.
Error Responses / Warnings	JSON API responses or redirect with error flash	Backend sends error if strictness fails.
User Messages	Frontend JS or template flash alerts	Friendly frontend prompts.
📣 In simple words:
✅ Flex Mode is set in the frontend during planning
✅ Auto Fill is a frontend helper
✅ Enforcement of full containment is the backend's job
✅ Friendly warnings or export lists are frontend jobs

This split ensures security (can't bypass by hacking frontend) and smooth UX.

📣 Very Short Diagram

Frontend
  - Flex Mode Toggle
  - Auto Fill Button
  - Container Fill Progress
  - Submit Plan
Backend
  - Confirm projected yield
  - Confirm container fill
  - Enforce strict or allow flex
  - Start batch or return error
Frontend
  - Show success or errors
✅ So they are stored in the frontend during planning,
✅ and enforced in the backend during batch start.

✅ This was intentional — it's correct and scalable.
