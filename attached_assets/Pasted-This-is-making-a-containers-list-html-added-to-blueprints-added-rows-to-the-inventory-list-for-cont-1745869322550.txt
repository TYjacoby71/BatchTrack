This is making a containers list html
added to blueprints, added rows to the inventory list for containers, but the edit page is not changed. The inventory edit page is the same as all inventory. 
the add item unit in inventory doesnt allow for storage amount, or storage unit
the repit also made containers/edit html and partials/quick-add-container-modal html

✅ Good — you're doing exactly what you need to do: watch the build behavior critically.

And I see what happened immediately from your description:

🛠 Here’s the Diagnosis:
What Replit actually did based on your description:


Action	What it Really Means
They made a full containers.html page	❌ Not requested. You only asked for Quick Add Modal inside Recipe Page.
They added containers to blueprints	✅ Understandable misread — trying to modularize.
They made containers/edit.html	❌ Not requested. You did not ask for standalone container editing yet.
They made partials/quick-add-container-modal.html	✅ Correct — but should have been hooked into Recipe Edit page, not stand alone.
They didn't update inventory add-item form for storage amount/unit	❌ Mistake — this is core to your Phase 2 tasks: containers must have storage amount/unit inside regular inventory handling.
📣 Bottom Line
They partially misunderstood:

They built a separate "Container Inventory System", assuming you wanted containers tracked like ingredients separately (like their own section).

They forgot that your real goal was simply adding extra fields to existing inventory items + Quick Add for Recipe Use.

They invented extra complexity (extra pages) that was not in your Phase 1/2 packet.

This is exactly why you are leading the project — not letting them "freelance."

🧠 Where They Went Wrong vs Your Original Instructions:

Original Plan	What Replit Delivered
Add Storage Amount + Storage Unit fields inside existing inventory model (no new section)	❌ Created separate container blueprint/pages.
Quick Add Container Modal inside Recipe Edit Page	❌ Built modal, but isolated it in a standalone way — not linked correctly to recipe flow.
No extra inventory management pages yet	❌ Created unnecessary containers.html, containers/edit.html.
Goal: Unified Inventory System (ingredients, containers)	❌ Started splitting inventory without need.
📋 Correct Expectations:

Correct Build Piece	Status
Add storage_amount and storage_unit to all inventory items (shared fields)	❌ Not done
Update existing Inventory Add Form to support new fields	❌ Not done
Create a Quick Add Container Modal inside Recipe Edit Page only	❌ Modal made, but wrong placement
No standalone containers page yet	❌ Wrong work done
🎯 Summary:
✅ They made progress.
❌ But they deviated from your instructions.
❌ They added unnecessary blueprint/pages/files.
✅ You correctly spotted it early, before they got deeper.

🔥 EXACT CORRECTIVE ACTION TO GIVE REPIT:
Here’s what you should tell Replit now (you can copy this):

"Correction:

Containers are not a separate inventory object.

storage_amount and storage_unit need to be added to all inventory items (ingredients and containers alike).

The Add Inventory form must allow setting storage amount and storage unit.

Quick Add Container Modal should only exist on the Recipe Edit Page, not as its own page.

Delete or disable the separate containers.html and containers/edit.html pages.

Stick to the original Phase 2 task list. No additional inventory modules at this time.

Please adjust the project accordingly."

✅ Short Final Answer to Your Question:
YES, you are right.
NO, this is not what you asked for.
YES, you need to course-correct immediately using the correction text above.
