✅ Got it — I’ll do ALL THREE in stages so you end up with:

A mapped breakdown of the user, organization, and permission system (tables, relationships, flows).

A full service + system architecture map (BatchTrack’s "authoritative service" hierarchy + data flow).

A rewritten README + docs structure that you can hand to Replit or any dev so they follow the right flow without breaking service authority or scoping rules.

🔹 STAGE 1: User / Organization / Permission System Mapping
1.1 User Types
User Type	Scope	Organization ID	Permissions Source	Notes
Developer	System-wide	NULL (no org)	Hardcoded user_type = "developer" → Full access bypass	Runs BatchTrack SaaS itself. No roles inside customer orgs.
Organization Owner	Single organization	Required	Has all permissions for their subscription tier	Manages roles, invites team members.
Team Member	Single organization	Required	Permissions come from assigned Roles	Limited by subscription tier & owner-assigned roles.

1.2 Core Tables & Relationships
(confirmed from models & migrations)

scss
Copy
Edit
Organization
├── Users (1-to-many)
├── Roles (custom, org-scoped)
└── SubscriptionTier (controls feature availability & user limits)

User
├── Organization (nullable for devs)
├── UserRoleAssignments (can have multiple)
└── Permissions (through roles)

Role
├── Organization (null if system role)
└── Permissions (many-to-many)

Permission
└── required_subscription_tier (controls availability)
✔ Unlimited inactive users allowed, but active user count limited by subscription tier.
✔ Developer users are completely outside this structure.

1.3 Role & Permission Flow
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Organization Owner → Creates Custom Roles → Assigns Permissions → Assigns Roles to Team Members
No hardcoded permissions — everything checked via has_permission(user, "permission_name").

System Roles (Production Manager, Inventory Specialist, Viewer) are seeded by developers.

Custom Roles are per-organization, editable by org owners.

1.4 Subscription Tiers
Tier	Features	User Limit
Free	Basic production, limited inventory	1
Team	Full production, advanced inventory, custom roles	~10
Enterprise	All features, API, unlimited users	Unlimited active users

The subscription tier acts as the final filter — even if a role grants a permission, it won’t work if the tier doesn’t allow it.

1.5 User Management Actions
✅ Org Owner can:

Invite user (adds to User table with org_id & default inactive)

Edit user (role assignments, active/inactive toggle)

Delete user (soft delete preferred)

✅ Developers can:

Access any org (for support) via "Developer Support Mode" (does not change user/org table)

🔹 STAGE 2: Full Service + System Architecture Map
BatchTrack is properly built as a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
Each service is authoritative over its domain — DO NOT bypass.

2.1 Service Authority Table
Service	File	Authority	Must Be Used For
FIFO Service	app/blueprints/fifo/services.py	Inventory lot ordering & deductions	All FIFO deductions & lot history
Inventory Adjustment Service	app/services/inventory_adjustment.py	Any stock change	Restocks, spoilage, recounts
Unit Conversion Service	app/services/unit_conversion.py	Measurement conversions	Ingredient scaling & cross-unit deductions
Stock Check Service	app/services/stock_check.py	Real-time availability	Batch planning & warnings
Expiration Service	app/blueprints/expiration/services.py	Shelf-life & expiration alerts	Alerts & lot cleanup
Reservation Service	app/services/reservation_service.py	Pending order inventory locks	Shopify/Etsy integration later

Important Guardrail:
✔ Every inventory change → Inventory Adjustment Service → FIFO Service (never direct model edits).

2.2 Data Flow Example (Batch Production)
sql
Copy
Edit
Recipe → Plan Production → Start Batch → Deduct Ingredients (FIFO) → Finish Batch → Add Product SKUs
Detailed Flow:

Stock Check → Ensures availability

Reserve (optional) → Holds inventory for planned batches

Start Batch → Deductions logged through FIFO Service

Finish Batch → Product SKUs added as new lots

2.3 Multi-Tenant Scoping
All scoped models (Ingredient, Product, Batch, etc.) require organization_id.

Developers skip scoping but must explicitly choose an org in "Support Mode".

ScopedModelMixin auto-applies filters:

python
Copy
Edit
Model.for_organization(current_user.organization_id)
2.4 Data Relationships (Simplified)
swift
Copy
Edit
Organization
├── Users ──┬── Roles ──┬── Permissions
│          │          └── UserRoleAssignments
├── Recipes ──┬── Ingredients ──┬── InventoryItems ──┬── FIFO Lots
│            │                 └── Expiration Tracking
└── Products ──┬── SKUs ──┬── ProductInventory (FIFO as well)
2.5 System Guardrails
✔ NEVER:

Write directly to inventory quantities → must go through Inventory Adjustment.

Deduct inventory without FIFO Service.

Hardcode permission checks → always use has_permission(user, permission_name).

✔ ALWAYS:

Scope by organization_id unless user_type == developer.

Reference FIFO entries by fifo_code consistently.

Update docs when adding new services.

🔹 STAGE 3: New README & Docs Structure
For a 10GB app, the README should be a high-level hub with links to detailed docs.

3.1 README Outline
✅ Sections:

Quick Start (install, migrate, seed, run)

Core Mission (who it’s for, what it does)

Key Features

Service Authority & Guardrails (MUST follow rules)

Architecture Map (small diagram + link to full docs)

User System Overview (types, roles, permissions)

Development Rules (5 bullet points)

Docs Index (links to /docs folder)

3.2 Recommended Docs Folder
pgsql
Copy
Edit
/docs
├── ARCHITECTURE.md (service authority & data flow)
├── SERVICES.md (FIFO, Inventory, Stock Check, etc.)
├── USERS_AND_PERMISSIONS.md (roles, orgs, tiers)
├── DATABASE_MODELS.md (tables & relationships)
├── DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md (adding features safely)
├── API_REFERENCE.md (routes, parameters)
├── QA_CHECKLIST.md (test before merging)
└── FUTURE_FEATURES.md (planned work)
✅ Next Step for Me
I’ll now:

Generate the full new README (ready for your repo)

Draft all /docs files with summarized tables, flows, and diagrams

Do you want me to start writing the full README now or should I generate all docs together in one structured drop?
If we do all docs together, it’ll be ~6,000 words but fully plug-and-play. Which do you prefer?

✅ Perfect — continuing with the FULL rewrite. You’ll get:

A brand-new README (structured for a 10GB SaaS-level repo)

Stubbed-out /docs files with all core context (you can expand later, but Replit will now “understand” service order, roles, scoping, etc.)

# BatchTrack

**Multi-tenant production and inventory management for small-batch makers**

BatchTrack helps soap makers, candle makers, and other artisans track recipes, manage batches, and maintain FIFO inventory — while scaling from single-user to multi-tenant SaaS.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database & run migrations
flask db upgrade

# Seed core data
python -c "from app.seeders.role_permission_seeder import seed_roles_and_permissions; seed_roles_and_permissions()"
python -c "from app.seeders.unit_seeder import seed_units; seed_units()"
python -c "from app.seeders.ingredient_category_seeder import seed_categories; seed_categories()"

# Start the server
flask run
🎯 Core Mission
Audience: Small-batch makers who need robust tracking without enterprise bloat

Goal: Clean, guided workflows for non-technical users, built on scalable SaaS foundations

Authority: Service-based architecture where each service controls its own domain (never bypassed)

📋 Key Features
✅ Batch Management – Start, track, and finish batches with QR/label codes
✅ FIFO Inventory – Automatic lot-based deductions and cost tracking
✅ Recipe Scaling – Unit conversions and ingredient scaling
✅ Expiration Tracking – Shelf-life alerts & batch-based expiration
✅ Multi-Tenant Organizations – Subscription-based user/role management
✅ Product Management – SKU generation, stock tracking, sales history

🏗️ Architecture at a Glance
Service Authority (NEVER BYPASS)
Service	Authority	Must Be Used For
FIFO Service	Lot ordering & deductions	All stock deductions
Inventory Adjustment Service	Any inventory changes	Restocks, spoilage, recounts
Unit Conversion Service	Measurement conversions	Scaling recipes, batch deductions
Stock Check Service	Real-time availability	Batch planning & warnings
Expiration Service	Shelf-life tracking	Alerts & expired lot cleanup
Reservation Service	Pending order locks	Shopify/Etsy future integration

Multi-Tenant Scoping
All data scoped by organization_id

Developers (user_type="developer") have no organization_id — system-wide only

Scoped queries must always use:

python
Copy
Edit
Model.for_organization(current_user.organization_id)
User System
User Type	Scope	Permissions	Notes
Developer	System-wide	All permissions	No organization; admin/support use only
Organization Owner	Single org	All tier-available permissions	Can create roles & invite users
Team Member	Single org	Role-based	Permissions limited by subscription tier

Roles are simply permission groups; subscription tiers filter which permissions can be used.

🔒 Development Guardrails
NEVER write directly to models that are service-controlled (use services only)

ALWAYS scope by organization_id unless user_type == "developer"

NO hardcoded role checks – always use has_permission(user, "permission_name")

Reference FIFO lots consistently via fifo_code (never just ID)

Update docs when adding new services or routes

# BatchTrack Architecture

BatchTrack is built as a **service-oriented SaaS** where each service owns its domain completely.  

---

## Core Principles

✔ **Service Authority** – One source of truth per domain (NEVER bypass services)  
✔ **Multi-Tenant Scoping** – All data filtered by `organization_id`  
✔ **Permission-Driven Access** – No hardcoded role checks, always use `has_permission()`

### Key Services

| Service | Authority | Typical Usage |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **FIFO** | Lot deduction order | Deduct inventory for batches |
| **Inventory Adjustment** | All stock changes | Restocks, spoilage, recounts |
| **Unit Conversion** | Measurement conversions | Recipe scaling |
| **Stock Check** | Real-time availability | Batch planning |
| **Expiration** | Shelf-life tracking | Alerts, expired cleanup |
| **Reservation** | Pending order locks | Future Shopify/Etsy integration |

## Data Flow Examples

### Batch Production
Recipe → Plan Production → Stock Check → Start Batch → FIFO Deductions → Finish Batch → Product SKUs

## Multi-Tenant Rules

✔ All scoped models must have `organization_id`.  
✔ Developers (`user_type=developer`) have no org, system-wide access.  
✔ Scoped queries must use `ScopedModelMixin`.

I’ll now write out all the /docs files fully (condensed but detailed enough for Replit to learn your architecture).
Do you want me to:

✅ A) Generate all 7 docs now in one drop (6-8k words),
✅ B) Focus on USERS_AND_PERMISSIONS.md first (since that’s your current bottleneck),
✅ C) Or write them in priority order (Users → Services → Database → Others)?

ChatGPT said:
✅ Perfect — we’ll do C: Priority Order (Users → Services → Database → Others).
I’ll start by fully writing USERS_AND_PERMISSIONS.md because that’s where the confusion is right now (user types, roles, subscription tiers, etc.).

# Users & Permissions System

BatchTrack uses a **clear, hierarchical user and permission system** designed for multi-tenant SaaS. This guide explains how users, roles, and subscription tiers interact.

---

## 1. User Types (Immutable)

User types are **hard-coded classifications**. They are NOT roles and should never be stored in the same table as roles.

| User Type | Scope | Organization ID | Permissions | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|------------------|------------|---------|
| **Developer** | System-wide | **None** | All permissions globally | BatchTrack staff/admin only |
| **Organization Owner** | Single organization | Required | All permissions available to their subscription tier | Business owner |
| **Team Member** | Single organization | Required | Based on assigned roles | Staff invited by org owner |

✅ **Rules:**
- Developers exist **outside the SaaS customer side**.  
- Org Owners & Team Members always belong to an organization (`organization_id` required).  
- Developers should never receive `organization_id`.  

---

## 2. Roles

Roles are **permission groupings** and are the bridge between users and permissions.

| Role Type | Created By | Editable By | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| **System Roles** | Developers | No | Predefined defaults (e.g., "Production Manager") |
| **Custom Roles** | Organization Owners | Yes | Scoped to their organization |

### Default System Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Production Manager** | `batch.start`, `batch.finish`, `inventory.adjust` |
| **Inventory Specialist** | `inventory.restock`, `inventory.adjust`, `reports.view` |
| **Viewer** | `reports.view` only |

✅ **Organization owners automatically have ALL permissions available for their subscription tier.**

---

## 3. Permissions

Permissions are **atomic actions** (never tied directly to user types).  
Example categories:

| Category | Example Permissions |
|----------|---------------------|
| **batches** | `batch.start`, `batch.finish`, `batch.cancel` |
| **inventory** | `inventory.adjust`, `inventory.restock`, `inventory.view` |
| **products** | `product.create`, `product.archive` |
| **users** | `user.invite`, `user.assign_roles` |
| **reports** | `reports.view`, `reports.export` |
| **settings** | `settings.update`, `settings.manage_roles` |

✅ **Never hardcode permissions** in routes — always check via:

```python
if has_permission(current_user, 'inventory.adjust'):
    # allowed action
4. Subscription Tiers
Subscription tiers determine which permissions can even be granted to users in that organization.

Tier	Max Users	Features / Permission Categories
Free	1 active user	Basic production tracking, limited inventory
Team	10 active users	Full batch & inventory features, custom roles
Enterprise	Unlimited	All features, API integration

✅ Inactive users do NOT count toward subscription limits.

5. User Management Workflow
Developer Workflow
Developer logs into developer dashboard (separate from SaaS UI).

Can view or impersonate organizations for support.

No organization_id is ever assigned.

Organization Owner Workflow
Access Organization Dashboard.

Create Custom Roles with available permissions.

Invite team members (via email).

Assign roles to team members.

Team Member Workflow
Accepts invitation and creates account.

Only sees features they have permissions for.

6. Data Scoping Rules
Scoped Models
All models except Developers are scoped by organization_id.

python
Copy
Edit
class ScopedModelMixin:
    organization_id = db.Column(
        db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('organization.id'), nullable=False
    )

    @classmethod
    def for_organization(cls, org_id):
        return cls.query.filter_by(organization_id=org_id)
Developer Pattern
Developers select an organization to view customer data but never modify their own user type.

python
Copy
Edit
if current_user.user_type == "developer":
    data = Model.for_organization(selected_org_id)
else:
    data = Model.for_organization(current_user.organization_id)
7. Permission Checking
Route Example
python
Copy
Edit
@require_permission('inventory.adjust')
def adjust_inventory_route():
    # Authorized only if user has permission
Template Example
html
Copy
Edit
{% if has_permission('user.invite') %}
<button class="btn btn-primary">Invite User</button>
{% endif %}
8. Best Practices
✔ Developers NEVER receive roles or organization IDs.
✔ Always filter by organization_id for customer data.
✔ Org Owners always have all tier-allowed permissions (don’t reassign manually).
✔ Only Team Members are role-limited.
✔ All permissions must be stored in DB, no hardcoding.

✅ **Next Steps:**  
I’ll now continue by writing **`SERVICES.md`** (full authority & usage patterns for FIFO, Inventory, Expiration, etc.), then move to **`DATABASE_MODELS.md`**.

Do you want me to:  

✅ **1)** Immediately write **`SERVICES.md`** next,  
✅ **2)** Or pause here so you can review this structure first?
