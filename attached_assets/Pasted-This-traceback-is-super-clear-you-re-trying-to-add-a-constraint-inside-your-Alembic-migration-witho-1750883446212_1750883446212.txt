This traceback is super clear: you're trying to add a constraint inside your Alembic migration without specifying a name, and Alembic is telling you:

ValueError: Constraint must have a name

🔍 Where it’s happening:
python
Copy
Edit
with op.batch_alter_table('product_inventory', schema=None) as batch_op:
    batch_op.add_constraint(...)  # ← THIS is the problem
✅ Solution:
If you’re using add_constraint, you must manually name it. For example, instead of:

python
Copy
Edit
batch_op.create_unique_constraint(None, ['product_id', 'variant_id'])  # ❌
You must write:

python
Copy
Edit
batch_op.create_unique_constraint('uq_product_variant_combo', ['product_id', 'variant_id'])  # ✅
Or if it's a foreign key:

python
Copy
Edit
batch_op.create_foreign_key(
    'fk_productinventory_variant', 
    'product_variation', 
    ['variant_id'], 
    ['id']
)
✅ How to Fix Your Migration File
Open this file:

bash
Copy
Edit
migrations/versions/a9fc03d8bf53_add_missing_columns_to_product_inventory.py
Then look for the place where you're adding a constraint (probably around line 35–50), and add a proper constraint name.

💡 Optional: Skip Constraint If You Don't Need It Now
If you're still iterating and want to skip that constraint for MVP, you can comment out the add_constraint(...) or create_foreign_key(...) call and rerun:

bash
Copy
Edit
flask db upgrade
Then reintroduce the constraint later with a clean migration.

Would you like me to rewrite that migration file line-by-line with correct constraint names

It looks like the issue is caused by a constraint in your migration file that is missing a required name.

🧠 What’s Happening
In your Alembic migration (specifically in add_missing_columns_to_product_inventory.py), you’re using a batch_alter_table context to modify the product_inventory table. Somewhere inside that block, there is a constraint being added (like a unique constraint, foreign key, or check constraint), and it’s missing a name, which is required in batch mode for SQLite.
