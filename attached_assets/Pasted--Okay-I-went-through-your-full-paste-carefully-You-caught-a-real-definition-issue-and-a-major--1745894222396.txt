‚úÖ Okay, I went through your full paste carefully.

You caught a real definition issue ‚Äî and a major scope conflict between plan_production.js and main.js (and messy event handling).
I‚Äôll explain it clearly:

üìã Problems I Found in Your Code

Problem	Why It's Bad	Where It's Happening
1. Redefinition of updateProjectedYield() inside DOMContentLoaded	‚úÖ GOOD now ‚Äî You correctly moved it OUTSIDE so HTML can call it.	Fixed
2. Multiple DOMContentLoaded blocks in same page	‚ùó Confusing: plan_production.js + main.js both declare DOMContentLoaded events separately.	Everywhere
3. Conflicting event handlers (Example: multiple document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ...))	‚ùó It's okay IF they're cleanly separated, but if they touch same elements, it causes unpredictable bugs.	main.js vs plan_production.js
4. Missing scoped global variables like fillProgressBar, remainingDisplay, flexModeToggle, containmentError, startBatchButton, containerArea in plan_production.js	‚ùó When addContainerRow(), updateContainmentProgress(), etc run, they assume these elements exist as globals ‚Äî but they are not defined anywhere in JS.	plan_production.js
5. containers array used without being defined	‚ùó Inside addContainerRow() you do:	
${containers.map(...).join('')}		
but containers is not declared anywhere in your JS.	plan_production.js	
6. Duplicated updateStockCheckTable(data) function	‚ùó It's defined twice in main.js. Causes unexpected behavior when calling update table.	main.js bottom
7. $(document).ready() and DOMContentLoaded mixed together	‚ùó jQuery's $(document).ready() is the same as native DOMContentLoaded, so mixing them without care leads to inconsistent loading.	main.js top
üö® Specific Danger Points:

Danger	Details
containerArea, fillProgressBar, etc	Need to be selected inside DOMContentLoaded or explicitly queried outside
containers undefined	containers array is used in addContainerRow but it's nowhere declared globally or locally
jQuery + DOMContentLoaded both running	Risk of race conditions ‚Äî if one binds to an element before it loads
üéØ Very Direct Problems (no spin):

Real Issue	Fix Needed
updateProjectedYield() problem	‚úÖ Already solved
containers not defined	‚ùó Needs to be passed from backend or queried properly
DOMContentLoaded blocks	‚ö° Need clear separation between plan_production.js (only handles Plan Production page) and main.js (only handles global modals / quick adds etc)
Undefined global variables in plan_production.js	‚ùó Need to query DOM elements cleanly at load time
üì¶ Here's How We Should Fix It Properly:
1. In plan_production.js
At the top after DOMContentLoaded starts, fetch all needed elements:

javascript
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const scaleInput = document.getElementById('scale');
  const projectedYieldElement = document.getElementById('projectedYield');
  const fillProgressBar = document.getElementById('fillProgressBar');
  const remainingDisplay = document.getElementById('remainingToContain');
  const flexModeToggle = document.getElementById('flexMode');
  const containmentError = document.getElementById('containmentError');
  const startBatchButton = document.getElementById('startBatchButton');
  const containerArea = document.getElementById('containerSelectionArea');

  window.projectedYieldElement = projectedYieldElement;
  window.scaleInput = scaleInput;
  window.fillProgressBar = fillProgressBar;
  window.remainingDisplay = remainingDisplay;
  window.flexModeToggle = flexModeToggle;
  window.containmentError = containmentError;
  window.startBatchButton = startBatchButton;
  window.containerArea = containerArea;

  // Now you can safely call all your container-related functions
});
‚úÖ Now your functions (updateContainmentProgress, addContainerRow, etc.) can find these variables.

2. Containers Problem
You need to inject the containers list into the page via backend if you want to use it dynamically in JS.

‚úÖ In your plan_production.html, you should add:

html
Copy
Edit
<script>
  const containers = {{ containers | tojson }};
</script>
‚úÖ This way the array containers will exist when you call it inside addContainerRow().

Otherwise, containers is undefined ‚Üí JS crash.

3. Separate main.js and plan_production.js cleanly

File	Handles
main.js	Global behaviors: quick add unit, quick add ingredient, modals, navbar
plan_production.js	ONLY Plan Production page: scaling, stock check, containers, batch starting
‚úÖ Do not bind anything related to production batches in main.js
‚úÖ Do not bind anything related to modals or global site behavior in plan_production.js

4. Remove duplicate updateStockCheckTable function
‚úÖ Only leave one version ‚Äî preferably inside main.js if you're managing stock check globally.

üì£ In short:

Issue	Is it fatal?	How hard to fix?
updateProjectedYield() not global	‚ùå Not fatal	‚úÖ Already fixed
Missing container variables	‚ùå Yes, blocks container row adding	‚ö° Easy fix with element queries
Missing containers[] array	‚ùå Yes, blocks dynamic container adding	‚ö° Fix by injecting containers from backend
Multiple DOMContentLoaded	‚ö° Risky but manageable	‚úÖ With separation of concerns
Duplicate functions	‚ùå Ugly but not fatal	‚úÖ Delete duplicates
