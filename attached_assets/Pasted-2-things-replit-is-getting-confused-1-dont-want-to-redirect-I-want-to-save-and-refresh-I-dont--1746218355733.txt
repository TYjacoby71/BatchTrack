2 things. replit is getting confused. 

1 dont want to redirect. I want to save and refresh. I dont want a custom mappings page. The table that they go in is under the button. and this picture looks lik there are redundant routes now?

Excellent observations. Here's a breakdown of the two issues you've spotted and how to fix them:

✅ 1. No Need for a Separate Custom Mappings Page
You're absolutely correct.

You want /custom-mappings POST requests to save the mapping, then refresh the same unit manager page — not go to a hidden “mappings page.”

🔥 Problem:
This line in the route:

python
Copy
Edit
return render_template("conversion/mappings.html", ...)
...creates a hidden, redundant page (and route) that the user never sees.

✅ Fix:
Change this POST handler to:

python
Copy
Edit
return redirect(url_for('conversion_bp.manage_units'))
So the new logic becomes:

python
Copy
Edit
@conversion_bp.route('/custom-mappings', methods=['POST'])
def manage_mappings():
    # validation logic...

    db.session.commit()
    flash("Custom mapping added successfully.", "success")

    # ✅ This refreshes the unit manager page (which shows the table)
    return redirect(url_for('conversion_bp.manage_units'))
✅ 2. Redundant Route Block
You're also right that Replit is confused because there are two blocks for the same route:

python
Copy
Edit
@conversion_bp.route('/custom-mappings', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def manage_mappings():
Appears twice — once for POST only, and again with GET/POST.

🔥 Problem:
Two functions can’t share the same route endpoint in Flask — this will result in the second one overriding the first, or raise an error.

✅ Fix:
Collapse to a single route like this:

python
Copy
Edit
@conversion_bp.route('/custom-mappings', methods=['POST'])
def manage_mappings():
    # handle POST logic
    return redirect(url_for('conversion_bp.manage_units'))
Since you don’t want to render a page at /custom-mappings, there’s no need for a GET method or template return.

✅ Summary of Actions
Change	Purpose
✅ Remove the GET route for /custom-mappings	Avoid duplicate route declaration
✅ Modify the POST handler to redirect(url_for('conversion_bp.manage_units'))	Keep everything inside the unit manager screen
✅ Remove conversion/mappings.html if unused	Clean up dead templates
✅ Ensure mappings are always rendered from units.html	Which you already do

Would you like me to provide the cleaned-up routes.py section for this?
