🚨 Likely Missing Connections After Blueprint Refactor
✅ 1. Broken Links in Templates
Cause:
Old paths like /check-stock/... or /inventory/update still referenced in buttons, links, or form actions.

🔍 Check for:
href="/check-stock/{{ recipe.id }}"

action="/inventory/update"

href="/check-stock-bulk"

JavaScript fetch or redirect paths

✅ 2. Missing Blueprint Registration
Cause:
You moved the route to /routes/stock/routes.py but didn’t register the blueprint.

🔍 Fix:
In main.py or app.py, ensure:

python
Copy
Edit
from app.routes.stock import stock_bp
app.register_blueprint(stock_bp)
✅ 3. Form Actions Not Updated
Cause:
Forms in templates like update_stock.html or inventory_adjust.html still post to outdated URLs.

🔍 Fix:
Update:

html
Copy
Edit
<form action="/inventory/update" method="POST">
To:

html
Copy
Edit
<form action="/stock/inventory/update" method="POST">
✅ 4. Mismatched Route Naming
Cause:
The route exists (e.g., /stock/check-bulk) but a link uses /check-stock-bulk.

🔍 Fix:
Ensure every button or link that points to a stock-related function has a /stock/ prefix.

✅ 5. Template Not Found
Cause:
If the new route points to render_template("stock_status.html"), but that template was renamed or removed.

🔍 Fix:
Ensure the template file:

Exists under /templates/

Is not misnamed (e.g., stock_status.html vs single_stock.html)

Has proper {% extends "layout.html" %} and {% block content %} syntax

✅ 6. Route Logic Exists but No HTML Trigger
Cause:
You added routes to the blueprint but didn’t update UI buttons to point to them.

🔍 Example:
Route /stock/inventory/adjust is live

No button or nav item points to it

🔧 Fix:
Add links like:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="/stock/inventory/adjust" class="button">Adjust Inventory</a>
✅ 7. Unmatched url_for() Calls
Cause:
If using url_for("stock.check_stock_bulk") but the function isn’t named properly.

🔍 Fix:
Ensure function decorators match:

python
Copy
Edit
@stock_bp.route('/check-bulk')
def check_stock_bulk():
Then use:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="{{ url_for('stock.check_stock_bulk') }}">Bulk Check</a>
✅ Diagnostic Prompt to Give Assistant
Here’s a Replit Assistant prompt to find all of this:

Prompt to Replit Assistant:

We recently migrated stock-related routes to a new blueprint: stock_bp.
Please scan all templates and app files to find:

Any links (href, action) pointing to old paths:

/check-stock/...

/inventory/update

/inventory/adjust

Any routes missing the /stock/ prefix after blueprint refactor

Any templates referencing routes or functions that no longer exist

Any blueprint routes that are not reachable from the UI

List all mismatches and show recommended fixes.
