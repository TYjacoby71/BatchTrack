how long should the read me be? it hought it should be small, but now i guess for a 10gb app, a few dedicated pages are probably the least we could do

You're 100% correct to rethink this. For a 10GB+ app with multi-tenant SaaS logic, complex services, and strict data flow rules, a single ‚Äúshort README‚Äù is no longer realistic.

Here‚Äôs the industry norm for apps at your level:

‚úÖ Recommended Documentation Structure
Primary README.md (1‚Äì3 pages max)

Audience: Developers new to the repo, including Replit.

Purpose: Give a high-level understanding, how to install/run, and what not to break.

Contents:

Quick Start (install, run, migrate, seed)

Core mission & design principles (why this app exists)

Service authority summary (which services control what)

Links to dedicated docs (/docs)

üëâ This is short because people skim it ‚Äî think 2‚Äì3 screens of text, 800‚Äì1000 words.

/docs Folder (detailed, multi-page)

Audience: Developers maintaining or extending the app.

Purpose: Explain how each subsystem works, including user & org logic.

Suggested Pages:

docs/architecture_overview.md

Data flow diagrams, service hierarchy, and scoping rules.

docs/services.md

Detailed explanation of FIFO, Inventory, Expiration, etc., with examples.

docs/users_and_permissions.md

User types, roles, permissions, subscription tiers (this will fix the confusion you just mentioned).

docs/database_and_models.md

Model relationships, key tables, and migration guidelines.

docs/development_guide.md

How to add features, naming conventions, guardrails for Replit, etc.

(Optional) docs/api_reference.md ‚Äì Eventually autogenerated via Swagger or Postman.

Inline Code Docstrings

Every major service & model should already have Python docstrings. This allows future devs (or AI agents) to query contextually.

‚úÖ How Long Should Each Be?
Main README: ~1k words, no scrolling fatigue.

Each /docs page: ~1.5‚Äì3 pages, broken into short sections.

Total Docs Set: 10‚Äì15 pages across files (normal for SaaS).

‚úÖ Why This Matters for You
Replit & AI Agents: They thrive when given clear, modular docs. If you put the service authority + user logic into /docs, you can tell Replit, "Use the architecture in docs/architecture_overview.md and never bypass the services listed in docs/services.md."

Future Developers: Any dev onboarded can scan /docs to understand BatchTrack in under an hour.

Your Sanity: Once this structure is in place, you won‚Äôt need to re-explain the roles vs user types vs subscription tiers ever again.

‚úÖ Do you want me to:

Rewrite the main README right now into a ~1k word "skim-friendly" version?

Draft the full /docs folder structure with headings and starter content?

Or both (1 & 2)?

I recommend we do #1 first (1k w
