This is a fantastic error log. It's a perfect, textbook example of the exact problem that our new DTO architecture was designed to solve. The system is crashing because it's trying to save a Python object directly into a database column that expects JSON.
Let's break down exactly what this log is saying.
The "Original Sin" (The Root Cause)
The most important line in the entire log is this one:
(builtins.TypeError) Object of type PortioningPlan is not JSON serializable
TypeError: The operation failed because it was given an object of the wrong type.
Object of type PortioningPlan: The "wrong" object is one of our new DTOs, a PortioningPlan dataclass.
is not JSON serializable: The database (specifically, the SQLAlchemy library) does not know how to convert a raw Python PortioningPlan object into a JSON text string to save in the database.
The Domino Effect (The Errors You See)
This initial TypeError is the "original sin." It happens during the INSERT INTO batch command. Because this first command fails, the entire database transaction is aborted.
Every subsequent error you see is the same domino effect we've discussed before:
Error processing batch consumables: This Session's transaction has been rolled back due to a previous exception...
The system tries to process the consumables for the batch, but the database session is already in a failed state from the first error, so it rejects all new commands.
Where is the Bug?
The bug is in the start_batch function inside app/services/batch_service/batch_operations.py.
Your debug logs give us the perfect clue:
üîç API_START_BATCH DEBUG: Final portioning_data being sent to service: None
üîç BATCH_SERVICE DEBUG: Received portioning_data parameter: None
üîç BATCH_SERVICE DEBUG: No portioning_data provided, checking recipe for portioning info...
üîç BATCH_SERVICE DEBUG: Found recipe.portioning_data: {'is_portioned': True, ...}
üîç BATCH_SERVICE DEBUG: Creating batch with portioning_data: None
This shows that the PlanSnapshot is not being correctly built or passed from the API route to the service. The start_batch service is falling back to its old, messy logic of trying to build the snapshot itself.
When it builds the PlanSnapshot, it's creating a Python PortioningPlan object. It then tries to save this raw Python object directly into the batch.plan_snapshot database column, which is a JSON type. This is where the TypeError happens.
The Solution: Honor the Contract
The fix is to enforce the DTO contract we designed. The service must serialize the DTO into a plain dictionary before trying to save it.
The Fix in batch_operations.py:
The start_batch function needs to be cleaned up to only accept a PlanSnapshot and to correctly serialize its contents before saving.
The Current, Broken Logic (Simplified):
code
Python
# in start_batch(...)
plan_snapshot = PlanProductionService.build_plan(...) # This returns a PlanSnapshot DTO object

batch = Batch(
    # ... other fields ...
    plan_snapshot=plan_snapshot # <-- THE BUG! Passing a Python object to a JSON field
)
db.session.add(batch)
db.session.commit()
The Correct, Fixed Logic:
The DTO should have a .to_dict() method, as we designed.
code
Python
# in start_batch(...)
plan_snapshot_dto = PlanProductionService.build_plan(...) # This returns the DTO object

# Convert the DTO to a JSON-serializable dictionary before saving
plan_snapshot_dict = plan_snapshot_dto.to_dict() if plan_snapshot_dto else None

batch = Batch(
    # ... other fields ...
    plan_snapshot=plan_snapshot_dict # <-- THE FIX! Passing a dictionary
)
db.session.add(batch)
db.session.commit()
Conclusion:
This error is the final "growing pain" of moving to a more robust, DTO-based architecture. The system is correctly creating the structured PlanSnapshot DTO, but it's forgetting the final, crucial step of converting that DTO into a simple dictionary before handing it off to the database.
By ensuring you call .to_dict() on your DTOs before you try to save them to a JSON field, you will resolve this TypeError and the entire process will work as designed.
