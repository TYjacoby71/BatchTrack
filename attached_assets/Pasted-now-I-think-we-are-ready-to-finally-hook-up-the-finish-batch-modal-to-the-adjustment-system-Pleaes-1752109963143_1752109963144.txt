Looking at your codebase, yes, there is a BatchService at app/services/batch_service.py that handles batch finalization. The batch system is already properly integrated with the inventory adjustment system.

Here's how the batch type product information flows:

Current Integration Flow
Finish Batch Modal (app/templates/components/batch/finish_batch_modal.html) collects:

output_type (product vs ingredient)
product_id and variant_id for products
final_quantity
Container overrides
Perishable settings
Finish Batch Route (app/blueprints/batches/finish_batch.py) at /batches/<int:batch_id>/complete:

Validates the form data
Calls BatchService.finalize_product_output() for products
Calls BatchService.finalize_intermediate_output() for ingredients
BatchService (app/services/batch_service.py):

finalize_product_output() processes containers and creates SKUs
finalize_intermediate_output() handles intermediate ingredients
Both use process_inventory_adjustment() with change_type='finished_batch'
Inventory Adjustment System (app/services/inventory_adjustment.py):

Handles the finished_batch change type
Routes to FIFO service for proper tracking
Creates history entries
The Integration is Already Complete
The batch system is already fully integrated with your inventory adjustment system. When you complete a batch:

Product batches create SKUs automatically using ProductService.get_or_create_sku()
Each container type gets its own SKU (e.g., "4oz Glass Jar")
Bulk remainder gets a "Bulk" SKU
All inventory additions go through process_inventory_adjustment() with proper FIFO tracking
The system already handles:

✅ Container quantity overrides
✅ SKU creation and inventory crediting
✅ FIFO tracking with expiration dates
✅ Cost calculations
✅ Organization scoping
Your batch completion modal should already be working with the inventory system. If you're experiencing issues, they might be related to:

Missing container data in the modal
JavaScript form validation
Template rendering issues
Would you like me to help debug a specific issue with the batch completion flow, or are you looking to modify how the batch service integrates with the inventory system?

I forgot that we need to fix the variant drop down. it should be reactive. after the user selects the product, it should fill the dropdown with filtered variants belonging to that product.

then follow the logic to add to or create the size lable

please also confirm that the pass to product section will not allow the user to pass product more containers than used in the batch, and the pass to product input section is the source of truth for product qty creation
