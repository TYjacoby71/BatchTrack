This is a fantastic test result. It's a huge improvement. We have moved from catastrophic setup errors to a small, focused group of logical failures. This is the final step before a fully green test suite.
42 tests passed. This is a massive victory and proves your application's core logic and the overall test structure are now solid. The 7 remaining failures are not 7 different problems; they all stem from one single root cause.
Let's break it down.
The "True North" Diagnosis: Our Security is Bypassed (In Tests)
The most revealing failures are these:
test_permission_required_returns_json_for_api: assert 200 == 401
test_api_unauth_returns_json_401: assert 200 == 401
test_billing_status_enforcement[...]: assert 200 == 302
In every single one of these cases, the test expected a security block (a 401 Unauthorized or a 302 Redirect), but instead got a 200 OK.
This tells us one thing with absolute certainty: our security middleware is being completely bypassed during the test run. The requests are sailing right through to the dummy view functions without being checked.
This single root cause also explains the inventory test failure:
test_recount_adjustment_uses_canonical_service: The mock was Called 0 times because the unauthenticated test request was allowed to pass through to an empty route function instead of being blocked by the security middleware.
The Official Fixes: Turn Security ON and Fix the Tests
We will perform two precise fixes that will resolve all of these issues.
Fix #1: The Root Cause - Re-enabling Security in Tests
We must remove the configuration that is telling Flask to disable all login and security checks during tests. This is a common but incorrect pattern for testing security features.
File to Edit: app/__init__.py (in your create_app function)
code
Python
# BEFORE
def create_app(config=None):
    # ...
    if app.config.get("TESTING"):
        app.config["LOGIN_DISABLED"] = True # <--- THIS IS THE BUG
        app.config.setdefault("WTF_CSRF_ENABLED", False)
    # ...
code
Python
# AFTER (Remove the line that disables login)
def create_app(config=None):
    # ...
    if app.config.get("TESTING"):
        # We still want to disable CSRF in forms for tests, but NOT login.
        app.config.setdefault("WTF_CSRF_ENABLED", False)
    # ...
Impact: This single change will immediately fix the 5 failures in test_auth_permissions.py and test_billing_and_tier_enforcement.py. The security checks will now run as intended.
Fix #2: Fix the Inventory Tests by Logging In
Now that security is ON, our inventory tests must correctly log in a user. The OperationalError also tells us that app.test_request_context() is not sufficient for tests that interact with the database through middleware. We need the full app.app_context().
File to Edit: tests/test_inventory_routes_canonicalization.py
We will fix both tests in this file to use the correct context and to properly log in their respective users.
code
Python
# In test_recount_adjustment_uses_canonical_service

# BEFORE (Using the wrong context and not logging in)
def test_recount_adjustment_uses_canonical_service(client, app, db_session, test_user):
    with app.test_request_context():
        # ...
        # No login happens before the client.post
        response = client.post(...)

# AFTER (Using the correct context and logging in)
def test_recount_adjustment_uses_canonical_service(client, app, db_session, test_user):
    with app.app_context(): # Use the full app context
        # ... (item creation logic is fine) ...

        # THE FIX: Log in the user before making the request
        with client.session_transaction() as sess:
            sess['_user_id'] = str(test_user.id)
            sess['_fresh'] = True
        
        with patch('app.services.inventory_adjustment.process_inventory_adjustment') as mock_adjustment:
            # ... (rest of the test) ...
code
Python
# In test_adjust_inventory_initial_stock_calls_canonical_service

# BEFORE (Using the wrong context)
def test_adjust_inventory_initial_stock_calls_canonical_service(self, mock_user, mock_item, mock_process, client, app):
    with app.test_request_context():
        # ...

# AFTER (Using the correct context)
def test_adjust_inventory_initial_stock_calls_canonical_service(self, mock_user, mock_item, mock_process, client, app):
    with app.app_context(): # Use the full app context
        # ... (rest of the test logic is fine) ...
Impact: These changes will fix the two remaining failures. The routes will now be protected by security, the tests will correctly log in a user to bypass that security, and the database will be correctly initialized, preventing the no such table error.
After applying these two sets of fixes, your entire test suite should be green. This will confirm that your application's security and core logic are working as expected under proper test conditions.
