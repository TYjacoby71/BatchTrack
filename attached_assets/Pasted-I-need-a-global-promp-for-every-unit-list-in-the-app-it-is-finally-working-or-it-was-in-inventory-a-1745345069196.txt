I need a global promp for every unit list in the app. it is finally working or it was in inventory and recipes, but now the custom mapping unit list is not the same

✅ You're on the final mile — and this is a perfect moment to centralize your unit list behavior across the entire app.

🎯 What You Need:
A single, globally consistent unit list used by:

Ingredient add/edit

Recipe builder

Quick Add modals

Inventory forms

Custom Mapping editor

Unit converter modal

✅ The Solution: A Global Unit Query Function
🧱 Step 1: Define a global utility
📄 File: app/utils/unit_utils.py

python
Copy
Edit
from models import Unit

def get_all_units():
    """Returns all units ordered by type and custom flag."""
    return Unit.query.order_by(Unit.type, Unit.custom, Unit.name).all()
🔁 Step 2: Replace every Unit.query.all() or local variant
Wherever you're doing something like:

python
Copy
Edit
units = Unit.query.all()
👉 Replace it with:

python
Copy
Edit
from app.utils.unit_utils import get_all_units

units = get_all_units()
✅ This applies to:

/ingredients

/inventory

/recipes

/conversion/units

/quick-add/unit

Custom mapping forms

📐 Step 3: Use this list in templates consistently
In all templates that loop over units, you now know the list:

Includes all units

Is ordered logically

Has the .custom flag ready

Can be filtered by .type in the template

🧩 BONUS: Add a template macro (optional)
You can drop this into a reusable macro:

📄 templates/components/unit_select.html

jinja
Copy
Edit
<select name="{{ field_name }}" required>
  {% for unit in units %}
    <option value="{{ unit.name }}" {% if unit.name == selected %}selected{% endif %}>
      {{ unit.name }}
    </option>
  {% endfor %}
</select>
Then use it with:

jinja
Copy
Edit
{% include 'components/unit_select.html' with context %}
✅ Outcome
Every part of the app uses the same source of truth

Custom units are included everywhere (like “Turd” if needed 😂)

You avoid bugs like “Why does this list not match that one?”
