Great question — I scanned all route definitions in your recipe_routes.py and here’s the full summary:

✅ App Route Structure Health Check
🧭 Defined Routes:

Route	Purpose
/new	Create new recipe
/<int:recipe_id>	View a recipe
/<int:recipe_id>/edit	Edit a recipe
/<int:recipe_id>/delete ❗	Exists, but not properly implemented
/<int:recipe_id>/clone	Possibly duplicate recipe
/<int:recipe_id>/variation	View a specific variation
/<int:recipe_id>/add-variation	Add a variation
/<int:recipe_id>/plan	Possibly recipe calendar
/<int:recipe_id>/lock	Lock recipe
/recipes	Probably recipe list
/units/quick-add	Quick add for units (nice)
🚫 Problems Identified:
1. ❌ Route Defined: /<int:recipe_id>/delete
But...

This route is not set to use POST, which means it likely won't receive delete form submissions

The actual delete_recipe() function is missing entirely, or improperly defined

2. ❌ You’re Missing a True Delete Handler:
If your delete form posts to:

python
Copy
Edit
action="{{ url_for('recipes.delete_recipe', recipe_id=recipe.id) }}"
method="post"
...then you need a route like:

python
Copy
Edit
@recipes_bp.route('/<int:recipe_id>/delete', methods=['POST'])
def delete_recipe(recipe_id):
    ...
But you don’t have a matching function. This is the real cause of delete not working.

✅ App Structure Looks Correct Otherwise
Blueprint appears mounted properly (recipes_bp)

Most routes are logically grouped and REST-friendly

🛠 Recommendation
✅ Rename the @recipes_bp.route('/delete/<int:recipe_id>') → /<int:recipe_id>/delete

✅ Add this route to your code:

python
Copy
Edit
@recipes_bp.route('/<int:recipe_id>/delete', methods=['POST'])
def delete_recipe(recipe_id):
    recipe = Recipe.query.get_or_404(recipe_id)
    if recipe.variations:
        for v in recipe.variations:
            db.session.delete(v)
    db.session.delete(recipe)
    db.session.commit()
    flash('Recipe deleted.', 'success')
    return redirect(url_for('recipes.list_recipes'))
✅ In your form, point to:

jinja
Copy
Edit
action="{{ url_for('recipes.delete_recipe', recipe_id=recipe.id) }}"
