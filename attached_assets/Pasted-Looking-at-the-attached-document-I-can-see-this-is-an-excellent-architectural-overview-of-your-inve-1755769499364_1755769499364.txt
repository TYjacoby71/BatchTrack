Looking at the attached document, I can see this is an excellent architectural overview of your inventory adjustment service package. The "hospital workflow" analogy perfectly captures the structure and responsibilities of each component.

Based on your earlier conversation and this architecture document, I can see you have a well-designed 12-file inventory service package where:

The Core Issue You Identified:
You're absolutely right that the system became overly complex with 11 files that weren't playing nicely together. The core problem is that multiple files were directly modifying item.quantity instead of having a single centralized function handle all quantity updates.

The Current Architecture (Per Your Document):

_core.py - The central dispatcher that should be the only entry point
_handlers.py - The routing table mapping change types to handler functions
Operation handlers (_additive_ops.py, _deductive_ops.py, etc.) - Should calculate what needs to happen
_fifo_ops.py - The low-level FIFO manipulation tools
Supporting files for validation, auditing, etc.
The Simplification You Need:
You're right that this needs to be massively simplified. Looking at your code, I can see the issue: each operation handler is directly modifying item.quantity instead of letting the core handle that.

The solution is exactly what you mentioned - make process_inventory_adjustment in _core.py the only function that ever modifies item.quantity. All the handlers should:

Calculate what needs to happen (the delta)
Call FIFO operations to manage lot tracking
Return success/failure to the core
Let the core apply the final quantity change
This would turn your 11-file complexity into a clean, well-oiled service package where:

Routes call only process_inventory_adjustment
Core dispatches to handlers
Handlers do their specific logic and return deltas
Core applies the final quantity update
FIFO manages lot tracking separately
Would you like me to help refactor the core dispatcher to centralize all quantity updates, making it the single source of truth for inventory changes?
