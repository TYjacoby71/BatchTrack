You're almost there — and this setup is 90% excellent. Let's clean up the last 10% for clarity, scalability, and to match your mental model. Here's a full breakdown:

✅ YOUR SYSTEM STRUCTURE (AS WRITTEN)
You’ve got:

Class	Role
Product	The top-level product (e.g., “Royal Tallow”)
ProductVariant	The scent/flavor/etc (e.g., “Lavender”, “Unscented”)
ProductSKU	The sellable unit (e.g., “4oz Lavender Tallow in Glass Jar”)
ProductSKUHistory	FIFO log of stock movement for that exact sellable item (SKU)

This is solid.

🔧 THINGS TO FIX / IMPROVE
1. ✅ Size should not live in ProductVariant
You are correct — size belongs to the SKU, not the variant.
Your intuition is right:

Variant: differentiates formulas (e.g., scent, type, color)

SKU: adds physical packaging/delivery format (size, container, etc.)

Action: Remove these from ProductVariant:

python
Copy
Edit
# REMOVE from ProductVariant:
size = db.Column(db.String(32), nullable=True)  # ✅ move to SKU
2. ⚠️ product_id in SKU is technically redundant (but might be okay)
You’re still storing both product_id and variant_id on ProductSKU, even though variant_id → product_id is already implied by the relationship.

Options:

✅ If you want pure data integrity, drop product_id from ProductSKU.

⚠️ If you want easy product_id filtering, keep it but add a validation check to ensure sku.product_id == sku.variant.product_id.

We discussed this here already, but TL;DR:

Don't store the same relationship twice unless you really need the performance benefit. It invites bugs if you don't validate.

3. ✅ size_label and sku_code are excellent choices
These are doing the job perfectly:

size_label: human-readable (e.g., "4oz Glass Jar")

sku_code: machine-readable/Shopify-facing (e.g., "RTL-LAV-4OZ")

You're free to generate sku_code from the combination:

python
Copy
Edit
f"{product.slug}-{variant.slug}-{size_code}".upper()
And store that permanently — makes Shopify/Sync stuff way easier.

4. ✅ ProductSKUHistory design is excellent
You're tracking:

FIFO info

Change types

Batch + user info

Perishability

This looks rock-solid. No major changes needed there.

🧠 WHY THIS MODEL IS SCALABLE
By separating:

Product = category or umbrella name

Variant = formulation/scent/type

SKU = sellable instance (size/container/etc.)

You now mirror Shopify, Square, Etsy, and Amazon models — this means:

Shopify product = your Product

Shopify variant = your SKU (Shopify’s “variant” includes size + scent — your SKU handles that)

Batch links cleanly to SKU

FIFO and stock status operate at the SKU level, which is perfect

🔁 TO-DO LIST
Here's what I’d recommend doing next:

✅ Remove size from ProductVariant

❓ Decide whether to keep product_id in SKU:

If yes, add validator to ensure integrity

If no, remove it and always access via sku.variant.product

🧼 Audit product_service.py and product_routes.py:

Make sure all create/update flows respect this hierarchy

✅ Ensure SKU creation enforces uniqueness on:

(variant_id + size_label)

or your existing (product_id, variant_id, size_label, fifo_id)
