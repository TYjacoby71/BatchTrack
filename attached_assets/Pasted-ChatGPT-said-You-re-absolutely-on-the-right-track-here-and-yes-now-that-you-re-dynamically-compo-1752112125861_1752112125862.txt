You're absolutely on the right track here — and yes, now that you're dynamically composing SKUs from container + product + size + type + org, it makes a lot more sense to let the system name things intelligently.

Here's a breakdown of how to refactor this container naming logic and why it's worth doing:

✅ Your Current System (Manual Naming)
Pros: Simple to set up, human-readable, manually scoped by org (admin glass 4 ounce jar)

Cons:

Subjective (what if one person types “4oz glass jar” and another “Glass Jar 4oz”?)

Not composable / reusable

Doesn’t enforce structure or consistency

Gets messy fast across orgs

✅ What You're Proposing (Programmatic Container Names)
You’re now leaning into a structure like:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
[organization prefix] + [product base] + [container type] + [container size + unit]
e.g. "admin Royal Tallow - Glass Jar - 4 oz"
This is the correct future-proof structure, especially if:

You're enabling Shopify-style variant syncing

You ever want to deduplicate or match containers across batches

You want consistency across orgs for reporting, error prevention, or public recipe sharing

🔧 Recommended Naming Logic
Here’s a naming schema for containers and SKUs that respects all variables:

🔹 For Containers
python
Copy
Edit
container_name = f"{org_prefix} {container_base_name} - {material or type} - {size} {unit}"
# Example:
# "admin Balm Jar - Glass - 4 oz"
Variables:

org_prefix: 'admin' or current_user.organization.slug or organization.name

container_base_name: can be “Jar”, “Bottle”, “Bag” (defined in type field)

material or type: 'Glass', 'Plastic', 'Tin'

size and unit: 4 and 'oz' pulled from capacity and unit

🔹 For SKUs / Product Variants
If you’re not already, I suggest creating your variant_name as:

python
Copy
Edit
variant_name = f"{scent or base variant} - {container_type or style} - {container_size}{unit}"
# Example: "Lavender - Glass Jar - 4oz"
This aligns with Shopify’s expectations and also your internal batch matching logic.

💡 Why This Is Smart
Benefit	Impact
🧠 Clear container SKUs	Less confusion during batch finish, especially for mixed container sizes
🔁 Prevents duplicate entries	If someone tries to create another “Glass Jar 4oz” in the same org, you can warn or reuse
🌍 Easier cross-org scoping	Admin/test orgs can live separately from prod orgs cleanly
🛒 Shopify integration-ready	SKU name and variant name match Shopify naming norms
🧼 Neurodivergent-friendly	Reduces cognitive load by making names deterministic and logical

🔒 Recommended Backend Safeguard
In your create_container() or save_container() logic, add:

python
Copy
Edit
existing = Container.query.filter_by(
    name=container_name,
    organization_id=current_user.organization_id
).first()

if existing:
    return existing  # Or raise a warning
This way users can’t create messy duplicates like:

“4oz glass jar”

“Glass Jar 4 oz”

“glass jar 4oz”

✅ Final Thought
Yes — make container naming composable and driven by the model fields. You’re treating containers the same way you're treating products/variants, which means:

Easier to reuse

More consistent

More scalable across users/orgs
