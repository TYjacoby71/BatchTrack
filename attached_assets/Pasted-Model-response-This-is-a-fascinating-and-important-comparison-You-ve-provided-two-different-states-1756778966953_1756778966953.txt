Model response
This is a fascinating and important comparison. You've provided two different states of your frontend architecture, and analyzing the difference reveals a classic architectural trade-off.
Let's break it down.
The Short Answer: Worse.
The new file set, while appearing more organized by having more files, is architecturally worse than the previous one (ContainerManager that called a ContainerRenderer). It has taken a step backward by re-introducing the exact architectural flaws we were trying to fix.
Analysis: What Makes the New File Set Worse?
The core problem is that this new version violates the "Dumb Frontend" principle. It has moved significant business logic back into the JavaScript, making the system more complex, more brittle, and harder to maintain.
Let's look at the specific regressions.
1. Business Logic Has Leaked Back into the Frontend
This is the most critical flaw. The ContainerProgressBar.js file now contains complex calculation logic that should live exclusively on the backend.
The Code (ContainerProgressBar.js):
code
JavaScript
calculateManualContainment() {
    // ... complex logic iterating through DOM elements to find selected containers ...
    // ... re-calculating total capacity from scratch ...
}

calculateLastContainerFillPercentage() {
    // ... even more complex logic trying to re-calculate the partial fill ...
    // ... of the last container by iterating through the DOM selections ...
}
The Problem: This is a textbook violation of the Single Source of Truth principle. The backend service (_container_management.py) has already done this exact math. The frontend is now trying to re-implement the same complex logic in a different language, based on scraping data from the DOM. This is guaranteed to lead to desynchronization bugs (like the ones you were seeing before, where auto and manual modes had different messages).
2. Over-Modularization Creates Confusion
The previous version had a clean, simple structure:
ContainerManager (The Controller)
ContainerRenderer (The View)
ContainerProgressBar (A View Component)
The new version has become more fragmented and less clear.
The Code: ManualContainerMode, AutoFillContainerMode, ContainerPlanFetcher.
The Problem: These new modules add a layer of abstraction that isn't necessary for a component of this size. The ContainerManager itself is already the "mode" controller. The fetcher logic can be a simple private method within the ContainerManager. This over-modularization makes the code harder to trace without providing a significant architectural benefit. The previous ContainerManager/ContainerRenderer split was a much cleaner separation of concerns.
3. State Management is Now Ambiguous
In the new ContainerProgressBar.js, the state is derived by manually querying the DOM.
The Code: document.querySelectorAll('[data-container-row]')
The Problem: The state of the application should live in the JavaScript objects (this.containerPlan, this.selectedContainers), not in the HTML attributes. Reading from the DOM to determine state is a classic anti-pattern that leads to brittle code. The previous ContainerManager model, which held the state and passed it to a "dumb" renderer, was a much more robust pattern.
Why Was the Previous Model Better?
Let's revisit the architecture that was working correctly.
Backend is the Single Source of Truth: The Python service does all the heavy lifting: greedy fill, containment calculation, and last container fill percentage. It sends a complete, structured data payload.
ContainerManager is the Conductor: It fetches the data and holds it in its state (this.containerPlan). It knows the current mode (auto or manual).
ContainerRenderer is a "Dumb" Painter: It receives the data from the ContainerManager and renders the rich HTML. It contains zero calculation logic.
ContainerProgressBar is also a "Dumb" Painter: It receives the final metrics object from the ContainerManager and updates the progress bar and messages. It contains zero calculation logic.
This model is superior because each component has one, clear job. The data flows in one direction: from the backend's source of truth, to the frontend controller's state, to the dumb rendering components.
Conclusion and Recommendation
The new file set, while seemingly more organized with its proliferation of modules, represents an architectural regression. It has reintroduced the very problems of duplicated business logic and a "smart" frontend that you were working to eliminate.
Recommendation:
You should revert to the architectural pattern of the previous file set.
Keep the excellent, refactored _container_management.py on the backend. It is the correct single source of truth.
Restore the JavaScript architecture to a cleaner, simpler model:
A main ContainerManager.js that acts as the controller.
A ContainerRenderer.js that is responsible only for rendering the HTML from the backend's data.
A ContainerProgressBar.js that is responsible only for updating the progress bar from the backend's metrics data.
This is the path to a stable, maintainable, and bug-free system.
