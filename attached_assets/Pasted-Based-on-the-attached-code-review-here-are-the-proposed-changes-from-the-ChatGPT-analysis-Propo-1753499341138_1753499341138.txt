Based on the attached code review, here are the proposed changes from the ChatGPT analysis:

Proposed Changes from the Review:
Move business logic to service layer (120+ lines can be extracted):

get_tier_permissions() and user_has_tier_permission() → subscription_service.py
complete_signup_dev_mode() (≈120 lines) → signup_service.py
Stripe event handling → StripeService.handle_webhook()
Upgrade filtering logic → PricingService.get_available_tiers()
Remove redundant debugging - All the DEBUG: billing_bp print statements

Merge duplicate logic:

Price key building logic appears in multiple places
Stripe vs Dev mode activation logic
Debug billing route duplicates organization methods
Delete unused code:

dev_activate_subscription (if not needed in production)
Manual reconciliation logic (if no longer supported)
Current Services Analysis:
Looking at your /app/services/ directory and the codebase, here's what I found:

Existing Services:
combined_inventory_alerts.py - Stock alerts across products/ingredients
dashboard_alerts.py - Dashboard alert aggregation
inventory_adjustment.py - Centralized inventory changes
inventory_alerts.py - Basic inventory alerts
product_alerts.py - Product-specific alerts
product_service.py - Product operations
reservation_service.py - Product reservations
stock_check.py - Real-time availability validation
trial_management.py - Trial period management
subscription_service.py - Subscription operations
stripe_service.py - Stripe integration
pricing_service.py - Pricing calculations
unit_conversion.py - Unit conversions
statistics_service.py - Analytics
timer_service.py - Timer functionality
Redundant/Outdated Services to Consolidate:
Alert Services (3 services doing similar work):

inventory_alerts.py - Basic inventory alerts
product_alerts.py - Product-specific alerts
combined_inventory_alerts.py - Unified alerts
Recommendation: Keep combined_inventory_alerts.py, deprecate the other two.

Trial Management vs Subscription Service:

trial_management.py has trial logic
subscription_service.py likely has similar logic
Recommendation: Merge trial logic into subscription_service.py

Missing Services (from the billing review):

No billing_service.py - billing logic is in routes
No signup_service.py - signup logic scattered
Services That Need Updates:
dashboard_alerts.py - References expired inventory and fault logs, but some alert logic is duplicated in inventory services

stock_check.py - Good service authority, but should be the single source for all availability checks

FIFO Service (app/blueprints/fifo/services.py) - This is actually well-designed and authoritative

Would you like me to propose specific consolidations, such as creating the missing billing_service.py or merging the alert services?
