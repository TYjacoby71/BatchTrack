ðŸš€ Final Migration and Database Upgrade Phase (Post Step 9)
ðŸ“‹ WHY You Need Migration:
Throughout Step 4, Step 7, and Step 8,
âœ… we made schema changes (new fields on Batch and Recipe):


Table	Fields Added
Recipe	predicted_yield, predicted_yield_unit, requires_containers, allowed_containers
Batch	containers (PickleType list)
âœ… Right now, those fields exist in your models.py but not yet in the database schema.

âœ… To lock everything into place:

We run a final flask db migrate

Then a clean flask db upgrade

And now your app is safe for live usage.

ðŸ“¦ FINAL MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS
ðŸ“‚ Step 1: Make Sure Flask-Migrate is Ready
âœ… In your Flask project, you should already have these:

flask db migrate installed

flask db upgrade installed

migrations/ folder initialized

app.py properly configured with db = SQLAlchemy() and migrate = Migrate(app, db)

âœ… If all that is normal (you've been working in Replit or local with migrations), then âœ… you are good.

ðŸ›  Step 2: Run Migration
From your project terminal, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
flask db migrate -m "Add batch containers field and recipe yield fields"
âœ… This will:

Detect any missing fields.

Build a new migration file automatically.

âœ… It should say something like:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Detected added column 'containers' on table 'batch'
Detected added columns 'predicted_yield', 'predicted_yield_unit', 'requires_containers', 'allowed_containers' on table 'recipe'
âœ… It will create a file inside /migrations/versions/xxxxxxxx_add_batch_containers_and_recipe_fields.py.

âœ… âœ… âœ…
DO NOT SKIP THIS.
DO NOT MANUALLY MODIFY THE MIGRATION FILE.

ðŸ›  Step 3: Apply Upgrade
Then immediately after migrating, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
flask db upgrade
âœ… This will:

Apply the database changes.

Add the containers field to Batch.

Add the predicted_yield, allowed_containers, requires_containers fields to Recipe.

âœ… Your database will now match your models.

âœ… Your system will now safely run batches from production without errors.

ðŸ›¡ Safety Backup (Optional but Recommended):
Before running upgrade:

Make a copy of your SQLite .db file (just in case).

After upgrade, you can delete the backup if everything works.

This way, you can never lose existing batches/recipes even if something unexpected happened.

ðŸ“£ Short Checklist Before You Migrate:

Item	Status
Correct /templates/batches/in-progress.html installed	âœ…
Broken /templates/batches/batch-in-progress.html removed	âœ…
/routes/batch_routes.py points to 'in-progress.html'	âœ…
Flask app configured with db and migrations	âœ…
Ready to run terminal commands	âœ…
âœ… Then you are green-lit to migrate and upgrade!

ðŸ“‹ Final Migration Summary:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
flask db migrate -m "Add batch containers field and recipe yield fields"
flask db upgrade
âœ… DONE!
